    "This form of pair programming is a looser form of the Ping Pong Pattern. It works a little bit like two people driving in a rally car race, with one person driving (or typing) and the other navigating. The driver carries out the navigator’s instructions, but has the opportunity to make corrections or ask for clarification. This style is an effective antidote for the anti-pattern where the person typing often controls what is typed, placing the other person in a passive mode where they are merely watching what is happening. The driver and navigator regularly switch roles every 15 minutes or so.\n",
