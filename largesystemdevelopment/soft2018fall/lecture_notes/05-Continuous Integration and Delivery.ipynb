    "  > Any employee can deploy to production from Campfire with a single message. When someone pushes to master, after watching the tests pass, they're encouraged to immediately deploy to production. This way, everyone is responsible for their own code being production-ready, and people don't have to worry about pushing someone else's code and breaking production.\n",

    "  > Recently, this process got even better. Now, after someone pushes to master and the tests pass, master is deployed to production automatically. We have ways of preventing this from happening (an employee can temporarily lock deployment while they're collecting data, for example), but by default, production is always up-to-date with master.\n",
    "  > \n",

    "  * the Maven repository manager Artifactory (https://www.jfrog.com/open-source/),\n",
    "  * and the cloud server provider Digital Ocean (https://www.digitalocean.com).\n",

    "Note, some parts of the following guide build on infrastructure code and experiences from Praqma's CoDe training (https://github.com/praqma-training/code-infra).\n",

    "\n",
    "# Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a Java project consisting of three projects, which depend on each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project's source code can be found here:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Contracts: https://github.com/eguahlak/choir-contract\n",
    "  * A mockup of a backend: https://github.com/eguahlak/choir-backend-mock\n",
    "  * And a simple frontend: https://github.com/Jegp/choir-frontend\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, these Java projects form a simple web-application, which serves a list of names via a JSP (http://<your_remote_host>:8080/choir-frontend/ChoirManager).\n",
    "\n",
    "The contracts project consists of a set of interfaces and data transfer objects (DTO) and is used to let different groups of students implement their frontends and backend systems independently against a common specification and mockups.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this guide is not to detail this Java project. Instead, we just use it to illustrate some of the steps, which are required to setup a complete CI chain automatically deploying the project on a production server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, the projects depend on each other. The backend mockup depends on the contracts and the frontend depends on the two other projects. The package dependencies -as specified in the Maven metadata (`pom.xml`) of the respective projects- are illustrated in the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Packages](images/packages.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The contracts project and the backend mockup are build as a JAR files, whereas the frontend project is build as a WAR file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to fork the backend mockup and the frontend example Java projects (https://github.com/eguahlak/choir-backend-mock,  https://github.com/Jegp/choir-frontend) so that you can modify the IP addresses in the `pom.xml`s to point to your machine running the Artifactory instance. Of course, this is only necessary when you want follow this tutorial and you want to replicate this example.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# The CI Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a set of distributed developers working on their local computers and collaborating on the same source code via a Git repository hosted on GitHub. Since, for this example we do not have access to a proper build server, i.e., a separate machine, we decide to setup an Ubuntu virtual machine (VirtualBox), which will host our Jenkins build server. In case you have access to a proper build server the explanations in the following apply as well except that you can skip reading the part on Vagrant and apply the provision script (`vm/provision.sh`) directly on your machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a remote server -hosted at Digital Ocean, you can host it anywhere else according to your liking- we have, amongst others, a Docker container running an Artifactory instance, which serves our local Maven dependencies. Finally, to the same remote machine we will automatically deploy a Docker container, which hosts our web-application.\n",
    "\n",
    "The setup is illustrated in the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "![CI Setup](images/ci_setup.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, we have to setup a Jenkins build server in a Vagrant machine, we have to configure it, we have to setup a set of build jobs on it, we have to setup a remote machine with a dockerized Artifactory. The following sections provide a step-wise description on how to do so. You should have all necessary files after pulling these lecture notes. Alternatively, you can clone the project at https://github.com/HelgeCPH/cph-code-infra.git. Note, that `/path/to` in all of the following examples is the path to the directory in which you cloned this project. Furthermore, this guide assumes that you are in a Linux/Unix/GitBash environment using BASH.\n",

    "Updating your forked repository can be done like this:\n",

    "#### 1. Clone your fork:\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-FORKED-REPO.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Add remote from original repository in your forked repository:\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd into/cloned/fork-repo\n",
    "git remote add upstream git://github.com/ORIGINAL-DEV-USERNAME/REPO-YOU-FORKED-FROM.git\n",
    "git fetch upstream\n",
