    "# Version Control Systems (VCS)?\n",
    "\n",
    "  > Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.\n",
    "  >\n",
    "  > A VCS allows you to: revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, review changes made over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can generally recover easily.(https://gitbookio.gitbooks.io/progit/content/en/bf647454e36069fd16f1a7a35cf6a865/f2ed7342a63759f0b1b25e017216cd89.html)\n",

    "# Local Version Control Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Many people do version-control by copying files into another directory\n",
    "    * perhaps time-stamped\n",
    "  * **Drawback**: error prone! It is easy to overwrite files when in the wrong directory\n",
    "  * **Solution**: local revision control systems, like `rcs` are simple databases keping all changes to files under revision control\n",
    "    * keeps patch sets, that is, differences between files, from one revision to another in a special format on disk\n",

    "# Centralized Version Control Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "  * To work collaboratively and to enable versioning Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCSs) were developed, such as:\n",
    "    * [Concurrent Versions System (CVS)](http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/cvs)\n",
    "    * [Subversion (SVN)](https://subversion.apache.org/)\n",

    "    \n",
    "  * **Advantage**:\n",
    "    * You can collaborate and know approximately what others are working on and commiting\n",
    "    * One can administrate things like access controll, etc.\n",

    "  * More than a snapshot of the latest files on server\n",
    "  * Full clone of the repository, i.e., every checkout is a full backup of all the data including history\n",
    "  * Possibly more flexible workflows than with CVCS\n",

    "# Git Branching\n",
    "\n",
    "Many VCS hav some form of branching support. Branching means to diverge from the main line of development and continue to do work without messing with that main line. In many VCSs, this is an expensive process, often requiring you to create a new copy of your source code directory, which can take a long time for large projects.\n",

    "Many Git developers have only code that is entirely stable in the `master` branch —possibly only code that has been or will be released. Another parallel branch named `develop` or `next` contains work to test for stability —it is not necessarily always stable, but whenever it gets to a stable state, it can be merged into `master`. It is used to pull in topic branches when they are ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, we are talking about pointers moving up the line of commits. The stable branches are farther down the line in your commit history, and the bleeding-edge branches are farther up the history.\n",

    "\n",
    "That is, we can think about those branches as work silos, where sets of commits graduate to a more stable silo when they are fully tested.\n",

    "## Topic Branches\n",
    "\n",
    "A topic branch is a short-lived branch that you create and use for a single particular feature or related work. You saw this in the last section with the `iss53` and `hotfix` branches.\n",
