    "\n",
    "  > A hypervisor or virtual machine monitor (VMM) is computer software, firmware or hardware that creates and runs virtual machines. A computer on which a hypervisor runs one or more virtual machines is called a host machine, and each virtual machine is called a guest machine. The hypervisor presents the guest operating systems with a virtual operating platform and manages the execution of the guest operating systems. Multiple instances of a variety of operating systems may share the virtualized hardware resources: for example, Linux, Windows, and macOS instances can all run on a single physical x86 machine. This contrasts with operating-system-level virtualization, where all instances (usually called containers) must share a single kernel, though the guest operating systems can differ in user space, such as different Linux distributions with the same kernel.

    "# Hands-on VMs with Vagrant\n",
    "\n",
    "  > Vagrant is a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments in a single workflow. With an easy-to-use workflow and focus on automation, Vagrant lowers development environment setup time, increases production parity, and makes the \"works on my machine\" excuse a relic of the past.\n",
    "\n",
    "  > Vagrant provides easy to configure, reproducible, and portable work environments built on top of industry-standard technology and controlled by a single consistent workflow to help maximize the productivity and flexibility of you and your team. (https://www.vagrantup.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intro to Vagrant\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialize & Start a VM\n",
    "\n",
    "You can start your setup by creating a `Vagrantfile`. The argument to `vagrant init` is the name of the *box*. That is, \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ mkdir vm\n",
    "$ cd vm\n",
    "$ vagrant init bento/ubuntu-16.04\n",
    "$ vagrant up\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "  > After running the above commands, you will have a fully functional VM in VirtualBox running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS 64-bit. You can SSH into this machine with vagrant ssh, and when you are done playing around, you can terminate the virtual machine with vagrant destroy.\n",
    "  \n",
    "You can find a catalogue of available boxes at https://app.vagrantup.com/boxes/search\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, you can quickly setup development environments for many operating systems. For example, in the following the initialization and use of a FreeBSD and Windows VM.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ mkdir vm_freebsd\n",
    "$ cd vm_freebsd\n",
    "$ vagrant init freebsd/FreeBSD-11.0-STABLE\n",
    "$ vagrant up\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ mkdir vm_win\n",
    "$ cd vm\n",
    "$ vagrant init opentable/win-2012r2-standard-amd64-nocm\n",
    "$ vagrant up\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**OBS:** From now on there are no excuses anymore like: *\"I have a Windows laptop and cannot do that Linux exercise...\"*!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessing a VM\n",
    "\n",
    "You log onto a VM with SSH as in the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ vagrant ssh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can leave the guest VM with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "vagrant@vagrant $ exit\n",
    "$ \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Teardown\n",
    "\n",
    "You can put a running VM \n",
    "\n",
    "  * to sleep \n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  vagrant suspend\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * turn it off \n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  vagrant halt\n",
    "  ``` \n",
    "  * or remove it completely \n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  vagrant destroy\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Different Providers\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we always used VirtualBox as a provider. However, you can use many other, such as _VMWare_. But more importanlty, you can provision your VMs also to remote servers in the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ vagrant up --provider=digital_ocean\n",
    "$ vagrant up --provider=aws\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line would deploy your VM as droplet on DigitalOcean (https://github.com/devopsgroup-io/vagrant-digitalocean) and the second line would do similarly on Amazon AWS (https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-aws).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Closer Look to a Vagrantfile\n",
    "\n",
    "A `Vagrantfile` is just a Ruby script. That is, you write code to specify your development infrastructure.\n",
    "A provision script can be a plain shell script or one of many other solutions, such as [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/), [Puppet](https://www.puppetlabs.com/puppet), or [Chef](https://www.chef.io/chef/).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we will use only Bash scripts for provisioning in the lecture. In your project you can apply whatever suits you best.\n",

Additionally, `-p 8080:8080` tells Docker to forward the port `8080` from the container to the same port number on our host. The port number in front of `:` specifies the port on the host, which gets bound to which port of the container (number after `:`).
