# Assignment: Scaling

Either:
  
  * create a high-available setup with hot and standby server for your Hacker News Clone, or
  * create a Docker Swarm (or similar alternative technology) cluster for your Hacker News Clone in which all components run as services.

In both cases implement a rolling update strategy to your build chain.

**Deadline**: Sunday 25th of November 23:59:59

## Hand-in:

  * An URL to a markdown document on Github
  * That document describes.
    - which of the above two setups you chose and
    - what you did.

That is, the second part of the document is a guide explaining step by step what you did, either providing a sequence of commands or a sequence of screenshots with corresponding explanations.
