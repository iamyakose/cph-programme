# Business Intelligence 

## Week 41: Basic Machine Learning II

Announcements and general information is available through the [Moodle flow](https://cphbusiness.mrooms.net/course/view.php?id=3874). 

### Focus this week
We wrap up Block II on basic machine learning. Our focus for the week was multi-level class classification.

### Learning Objectives
In this block, you will gain knowledge of classification models. You will be able to setup a basic machine learning model in Python, and in Azure Mcahine Learning Studio (example of MLaaS, ML as-a-Service). You will acquire competency to decide which classification model to select for a given business question.

### Teaching and Learning Activities (TLAs)
- **Lectures:** 
  * We will review the basic ML cycle. 
  * Data foundation and choice of model.
  * Various classification metrics in ML. 
  * Balancing of data in classification (feature engineering)

- **In-class exercises:** Classification and validation metrics.

- **Reading _weeks 40-43_ :** 
  * Read from [The 100 Page ML Book](../100PageMLBook.pdf) on machine learning:

     - Chap. 1: All. 
     - Chap. 2: Sections 2.1.1 and 2.1.9
     - Chap. 3: From beginning until subsection 3.1.2 (inclusive, read carefully). 3.3 (you can ignore math, but understand the basic content in the words)
     - 4: 4.3 (read carefully)
     - Chap. 5: Sections 5.1 (read lightly). Sections 5.2, 5.3, 5.4 and 5.6 (very carefully)
     - 8: Section 8.1 (read lightly)
  * The Notebook [_'ImbalanceResamplingStrategies.ipynb'_](https://github.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2019fall-bi-teaching-material/blob/master/week41/lecture_notes/ImbalanceResamplingStrategies.ipynb) (./week41/lecture_notes). This might be useful for Assignment 7.
 
  * **NB: Supplement your reading with examples -- there are really good works on the internet. You can also find some example code here which is really neat:**
     - [Scikit-learn library: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
     - [Hands-on ML with Python: https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml)

     **_In particular the [Scikit-learn reading section on machine learning on real-world data sets](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/index.html#examples-based-on-real-world-datasets) can prove very rewarding, even if read lightly. The Jupyter Notebooks there are great and very clearly written._**

- **Homework:**
  * Work on [Assignment 6](https://github.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2019fall-bi-teaching-material/tree/master/week40/assignment_6) and [Assignment 7](https://github.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2019fall-bi-teaching-material/tree/master/week40/assignment_7), in groups.

**Estimated need for activity outside classroom:** A good 8-12 hours _per week_ during weeks 40-43. Mostly due to the reading and example studies (from the resources listed above), and the work with hand-in Assignment 6 and 7, **with your group!**.
