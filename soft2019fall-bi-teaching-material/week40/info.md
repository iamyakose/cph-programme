# Business Intelligence 

## Week 40: Basic Machine Learning I

Announcements and general information is available through the [Moodle flow](https://cphbusiness.mrooms.net/course/view.php?id=3874). 

### Focus this week
We will start up Block II on basic machine learning. The machine learning life cycle. Regression and single class / multiple class classification.

### Learning Objectives
In this block, you will gain knowledge of regression models and classification models. You will be able to setup a basic machine learning process in Python.
You will acquire competency to decide which machine learning model to select for a given business question.

### Teaching and Learning Activities (TLAs)
- **Lectures:** 
  * Get those exam questions finished. Review pensum for exam.
  * We will look at the basic ML cycle, some statistics concepts. Various classes of ML. Data foundation and choice of model.

- **In-class exercises:** Regression, classification.

- **Reading _over the next three weeks(!)_ :** 
  * Read from [The 100 Page ML Book](../100PageMLBook.pdf):

     - Chap. 1: All. 
     - Chap. 2: Sections 2.1.1 and 2.1.9
     - Chap. 3: From beginning until subsection 3.1.2 (inclusive, read carefully). 3.3 (you can ignore math, but understand the basic content in the words)
     - 4: 4.3 (read carefully)
     - Chap. 5: Sections 5.1 (read lightly). Sections 5.2, 5.3, 5.4 and 5.6 (very carefully)
     - 8: Section 8.1 (read lightly)
 
  * **NB: Supplement your reading with examples -- there are really good works on the internet. You can also find some example code here which is really neat:**
     - [Scikit-learn library: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
     - [Hands-on ML with Python: https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml)

     **_In particular the [Scikit-learn reading section on machine learning on real-world data sets](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/index.html#examples-based-on-real-world-datasets) can prove very rewarding, even if read lightly._**

- **Homework:**
  * Work on [Assignment 6](https://github.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2019fall-bi-teaching-material/tree/master/week40/assignment_6), in groups.

**Estimated need for activity outside classroom:** A good 8-12 hours _per week_. Mostly due to the reading and example studies (from the resources listed above), and the work with hand-in Assignment 6, **with your group!**.

### Resources

**Lecture Slides:** are made available through [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2019fall-bi-teaching-material), on an incremental basis.

**Code:** is made available through [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2019fall-bi-teaching-material), on an incremental basis. It will be almost entirely consisting of Jupyter Notebooks with Python code. You should make an effort to work on exercises _**with your group**_.
