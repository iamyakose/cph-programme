# Business Intelligence 

## Week 37 (week "36+1") -- Catching up: Python, Data Wrangling & Assignment 2.

Announcements and general information is available through the [Moodle flow](https://cphbusiness.mrooms.net/course/view.php?id=3874). 

### Focus this week
Hitachi Vantara will visit us, Wednesday the 11th, during classroom as announced on Moodle. Look forward; they have a good show in store for us!

Then, we will spend the last two hours of class continuing to work with Boliga data. Since assignment 2 seems a bit more challenging than was expected (most of the class stated familiarity with the Python laguage when asked).

### Learning Objectives
This week's work will enable you with basic knowledge of the 'NumPy' library, RegEx'es (regular expressions), and some more . You will develop skills to manipulate a dataset, and you will acquire competencies to devise simple visualizations, which may serve to achieve business insight.

### Teaching and Learning Activities (TLAs)
- **Lectures:** Hitachi Vantara will give a presentation of their activities around the globe, and a bit of technical insight into their data science platform, 'Pentaho'. There will be no additional lectures this week.

- **In-class exercises:** 
   - Three exam questions to be formulated.
   - Working on assignment 2. Assignment 3 will be pushed to next week.

- **Reading/Homework:** During this week, very carefully through, the  notebooks: 
  * _'07-Intro to NumPy.ipynb'_, 
  * _'08-Intro to Regular Expressions.ipynb'_, and 
  * _'09-Data Visualization.ipynb'_.

	found in GitHub under week37. **NB:** The last notebook has a broken link to Google's Maps API -- can you fix that?

**Estimated need for activity outside classroom:** A good 8 hours. Mostly due to the reading, but also since you must (still) complete hand-in assignment 2, **with your group!**.

### Resources

**Lecture Slides:** are made available through [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2019fall-bi-teaching-material), on an incremental basis.

**Code:** is made available through [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2019fall-bi-teaching-material), on an incremental basis. It will be almost entirely consisting of Jupyter Notebooks with Python code. You should make an effort to work on exercises _**with your group**_.
