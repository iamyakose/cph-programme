    "This tutorial is based on chapter 7 \"Pattern Matching With Regular Expressions\" of the book *Automate The Boring Stuff The Boring Stuff With Python* by Al Sweigart.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Regular expressions* allow you to specify a pattern of text to search for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions are huge time-savers, not just for software users but also for programmers. In fact, tech writer Cory Doctorow argues that even before teaching programming, we should be teaching regular expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Knowing [regular expressions] can mean the difference between solving a problem in 3 steps and solving it in 3,000 steps. When you’re a nerd, you forget that the problems you solve with a couple keystrokes can take other people days of tedious, error-prone work to slog through.\n",

    "## Finding Patterns of Text with Regular Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions, called regexes for short, are descriptions for a pattern of text. For example, a `\\d` in a regex stands for a digit character, that is, any single numeral `0` to `9`. The regex `\\d\\d \\d\\d \\d\\d \\d\\d` could be used  by Python to match a Danish telefon number, a string of eight numbers separated by whitespaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "But regular expressions can be much more sophisticated. For example, adding a `2` in curly brackets (`{2}`) after a pattern is like saying, \"Match this pattern two times.\" So the regex `\\d{2} \\d{2} \\d{2} \\d{2}` also matches the correct phone number format. It could be shortened even more to `(\\d{2} ){3}\\d{2}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Regex Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "All the regex functions in Python are in the `re` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Passing a string value representing your regular expression to `re.compile()` returns a Regex pattern object (or simply, a Regex object). Note, since regular expressions frequently use backslashes in them, it is convenient to pass raw strings to the `re.compile()` function instead of typing extra backslashes. Typing `r'\\d{2} \\d{2} \\d{2} \\d{2}'` is much easier than typing `'\\\\d{2} \\\\d{2} \\\\d{2} \\\\d{2}'`.\n",

If the pattern is found, the `search()` method returns a `Match` object. `Match` objects have a `group()` method that will return the actual matched text from the searched string."

The first set of parentheses in a regex string will be group 1. The second set will be group 2. By passing the integer 1 or 2 to the `group()` match object method, you can grab different parts of the matched text. Passing 0 or nothing to the `group()` method will return the entire matched text.\n"
