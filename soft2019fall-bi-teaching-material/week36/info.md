# Business Intelligence 

## Week 36 -- Preprocessing Data

Announcements and general information is available through the [Moodle flow](https://cphbusiness.mrooms.net/course/view.php?id=3874). 

### Focus this week
This week we will work with data scraped from a danish business website that posts real estate sales, for the whole country. The data have been scraped and we will be doing some wrangling of data.

### Learning Objectives
This week's work will enable you with basic knowledge of the 'Pandas' library. You will develop skills to manipulate a dataset, and you will acquire competencies to devise simple visualizations, which may serve to achieve business insight.

### Teaching and Learning Activities (TLAs)
- **Lectures:** We will introduce the Boliga dataset, among other data taken from the internet. We will exercise to wrangle and manipulate the Boliga data. We will find the 2 exam questions (missing one from last week) for the final exam draw. The second assigment will be presented.

- **In-class exercises:** 
   - Forming the working groups: reshuffle after electives sign-up.
   - Forming GitHub groups: are we done?
   - Setting up a working Python environment, under guidance. Jupyter Notebooks, Vagrant, VirtualBox: are we done?
   - Two exam questions to be formulated.

- **Reading/Homework:** During this week, read carefully through, and run, the remaining notebooks, numbers 9 through 17, from _'A Whirlwind Tour of Python'_.

**Estimated need for activity outside classroom:** A good 6 hours. Mostly due to the reading, but also since you must complete hand-in assignment 2, **with your group!**.

### Resources

**Lecture Slides:** are made available through [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2019fall-bi-teaching-material), on an incremental basis.

**Code:** is made available through [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2019fall-bi-teaching-material), on an incremental basis. It will be almost entirely consisting of Jupyter Notebooks with Python code. You should make an effort to work on exercises _**with your group**_.
