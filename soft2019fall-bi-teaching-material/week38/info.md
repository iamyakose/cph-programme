# Business Intelligence 

## Week 38 -- Visit to Innofactor Denmark A/S & Assignment 3.

Announcements and general information is available through the [Moodle flow](https://cphbusiness.mrooms.net/course/view.php?id=3874). 

### Focus this week
We visit Innofactor, Wednesday the 18th, during classroom as announced on Moodle. Look forward; they have a good show in store for us!

Since both assignments 2 and 3 seem challenging we will keep working on those for the coming week (38).

### Learning Objectives
Learn what a Business intelligence stack looks like, in all aspects.

### Teaching and Learning Activities (TLAs)
- **Lectures:** Lecture at Innofactor Denmark A/S. There will be no additional lectures this week.

- **In-class exercises:** 
   None.

- **Reading/Homework:** During this week, very carefully through, the  notebooks: 
  * Review slides from Innofactor (in GitHub, week 38)
  * Review slides from Hitachi, _especially_ the technical talk (in GitHub, week 38)
  * Work on Assignments 2 & 3. 

**Estimated need for activity outside classroom:** A good 8 hours. Mostly due to the reading, but also since you must (still) complete hand-in Assignments 2 & 3, **with your group!**.
