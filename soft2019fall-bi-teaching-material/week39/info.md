# Business Intelligence 

## Week 39: End Block I, begin: Block II

* Catch-up on assignments
* Formulating exam questions

Announcements and general information is available through the [Moodle flow](https://cphbusiness.mrooms.net/course/view.php?id=3874). 

### Focus this week
We will round off Block I on data processing and visualization. We will catch up on assignments, and plan the remainder of the course.

### Learning Objectives
Learn to set up a database server in the cloud (Azure), and connect to it from a professional BI-reporting tool of your choice. This is to give a sense of the flexibility and speed which can be achieved in producing a report, almost from scratch. 

### Teaching and Learning Activities (TLAs)
- **Lectures:** There be no lectures this week.

- **In-class exercises:** 
   We will do the hand-in Assignment 4 together in class, so that it can be handed-in already this week, early. The objective is to make room for hand-in Assignment 5 to be released already this week as well.

- **Reading/Homework:** 
  * Read carefully the slides from Lasse's talk on Hitachi Vantara's Pentaho platform (in folder week 47). 
  * Work on Assignment 5. 

**Estimated need for activity outside classroom:** A good 8-12 hours. Mostly due to the hand-in Assignment 5, **with your group!**.
