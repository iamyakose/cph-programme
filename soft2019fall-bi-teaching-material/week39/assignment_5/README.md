  This will bring you to download [the Windows installer (exe file).](https://www.hitachivantara.com/go/try-pentaho-now/?ecid=ps_glo_bd_en_ss0091sem&utm_campaign=Google%7CPaid-Search%7CPentaho%7CDDI%7CBrand%7CEmea&utm_ad_group=Paid-Search%7CPentaho%7CDDI%7CBrand%7CTrial&leadsource=Google_Ads_Search&keyword=download%20pentaho&utm_medium=cpc&medium=Google_Search&utm_source=google&asset_name=Free_Trial&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI3da-pcHw5AIVk-R3Ch2X9gi4EAAYASAAEgLxEfD_BwE). 

  2. Launch the installer as administrator, follow instructions. 

  3. Once installed, you can navigate the 'Design Tools' folder in the Pentaho file hierarchy. From there you can launch 'Data Integration' -- launch as administrator. It takes a brave while for the application to get up and running due to it being run in a Java VM. So take a breather while it launches...

  4. Set up a data transformational flow, which: 
     * connects to the boliga data set
     * connects to the lat / lon data set
     * cleans the Boliga data set
     * adds the lat/lon data as two new columns
     * writes the modified table data to a csv file.
  3. Then export your flow as an XML file.
  4. Describe, directly in the XML file what it does -- make your explanation as comments.
  5. Write 5-10 lines of text discussing how this XML file could be useful, consider aspects like continuous integration/delivery, cron jobs, integration of data sources etc.
