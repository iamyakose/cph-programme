    "# Installing Python in a Virtual Machine\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following is a step by step guide to get you up and running.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Download and install VirtualBox (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)\n",
    "  * Download and install Vagrant (https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)\n",
    "    * To get started with Vagrant on Windows, see https://www.sitepoint.com/getting-started-vagrant-windows/ Focus in particular on using PuTTY instead of SSH on Windows\n",
    "or alternatively install Git on Windows and follow the directions: http://stackoverflow.com/a/16247703\n",
    "    * On Unix'ish operating systems, if you did not already generate an SSH keypair, generate one (e.g., via `ssh-keygen -t rsa`)\n",
    "  * Clone this repository into a directory of your choice (`/path/to/`):\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    git clone https://github.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2017fall-business-intelligence-teaching-material.git \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  * On the command line change directory to where you cloned this repository (`/path/to/cloned/repo/vm`). Likely, it is just:\n",
    "  \n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    cd ./soft2017fall-business-intelligence-teaching-material/vm\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  * Subsequently, start up the VM, which will take a bit on the first start up as it has to download the Ubuntu image and a bit of other software.\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    vagrant up\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  * To log onto the virtual machine (VM) execute\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    vagrant ssh\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  * Now you can start the Jupyter Notebook server (to program in the browser) via:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    vagrant@vagrant:~$ cd /synced_folder/lecture_notes\n",
    "vagrant@vagrant:~$ notebook\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    **Note** The `notebook` command is just an alias to the complete command `jupyter notebook --no-browser --ip=0.0.0.0 --NotebookApp.token=\"\"` The `notebook` command is context sensitive. That is, the server is always started in the scope of the current directory. When you have your notebooks stored in another directory than the one in which you execute `notebook`, then you have change directories before.\n",
    "    \n",
    "  * Now you should be able to connect to the Jupyter Notebook server by connecting to http://localhost:8888 in the browser of your choice. \n",
    "  * In case you are done working on your virtual machine, you can leave it by issuing the `exit` command. Subsequently, you can put the virtual machine to \"sleep\" (just like closing the lid of your notebook) by running `vagrant suspend` on your host machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    vagrant@vagrant:~$ exit\n",
    "    vagrant suspend\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  * In case you want to discard this VM just run `vagrabt destroy` from within the `./soft2017fall-business-intelligence-teaching-material/vm` directory.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "# Installing Python Directly to your Machine\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to get up and running is to install Python via the Anaconda distribution. It comes with many Python packes pre-installed and helps you to get productive quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Go to https://www.continuum.io/downloads\n",
    "  * Download the Anaconda **Python 3.6 version** installer for your operating system (Windows, Linux, and macOS are supported)\n",
    "    - https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.4.0-Windows-x86_64.exe\n",
    "    - https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.4.0-Linux-x86_64.sh\n",
    "    - https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.4.0-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg\n",
    "  * After downloading follow the installation instructions on https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/#detailed-installation-information\n",
    "    * Clone this repository into a directory of your choice (`/path/to/`):\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    git clone https://github.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2017fall-business-intelligence-teaching-material.git \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  * On the command line change directory to where you cloned this repository (`/path/to/soft2017fall-business-intelligence-teaching-material/lecture_notes`). Likely, it is just:\n",
    "  \n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    cd ./soft2017fall-business-intelligence-teaching-material/lecture_notes\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  * Start the Jupyter notebook server\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  ~$ jupyter notebook\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "    * **Note** The `jupyter notebook` command is context sensitive. That is, it is always started in the scope of the current directory. When you have your notebooks stored in another directory than the one in which you execute `jupyter notebook`, then you have change directories before.\n",
    "  * The former command should open a browser window similar to the following ![local_notebook](./images/local_notebook.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using a Web Service\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various ways to access Python via Jupyter Notebooks hosted as a service. Here, we will show how to use Jupyter Notebooks hosted on Microsoft Azure.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Go to https://studio.azureml.net\n",
    "  * You should be able to login with your school account. \n",
    "    - If not create a new account if you do not already have a Microsoft account.\n",
    "  * After logging into the service you should see a page similar to the following ![login](./images/login.png)\n",
    "  * Click on `NOTEBOOKS` to the left and create a new empty notebook by clicking `+` and subsequently choosing `Python 3 Blank Notebook` ![new_notebook](./images/new_notebook.png)\n",
    "  * Give your new notebook a representative name ![name_new_notebook](./images/name_new_notebook.png)\n",
    "  * After a short time, you can start coding in your new notebook ![code_notebook](./images/code_notebook.png)\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "**OBS** The Azure Web Environment did not work in Safari for me. However, in Chromium, Firefox, etc. it worked.\n",

    "  8. Write a single line program that computes the sum of a range of integer values without using the `sum()` function and without using a loop.\n",
    "  9. Use the `range()` function and a `for` loop to create a list of the odd numbers from 1 to 20."
