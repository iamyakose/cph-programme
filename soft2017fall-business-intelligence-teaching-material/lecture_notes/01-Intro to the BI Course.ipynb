    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition 1\n",
    "> Business intelligence, or BI, is an umbrella term that refers to a variety of software applications used to analyze an organizationâ€™s raw data. BI as a discipline is made up of several related activities, including data mining, online analytical processing, querying and reporting.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Companies use BI to improve decision making, cut costs and identify new business opportunities. BI is more than just corporate reporting and more than a set of tools to coax data out of enterprise systems. CIOs use BI to identify inefficient business processes that are ripe for re-engineering.\n",
    "http://www.cio.com/article/2439504/business-intelligence/business-intelligence-business-intelligence-definition-and-solutions.html\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition 2\n",
    "> First of all, BI isn't just a pile of information, it's actually a whole set of theories and processes that help professionals sort through and analyze the information they collect.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> A lot of information passes through a company's internal network, but this information must be organized and presented in a relevant, contextualized way before it is useful in the decision-making processes of an organization.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Good BI is instrumental in making businesses successful. The information gathered and sorted by BI analysts helps companies better understand their history, where they stand and how they might grow in the future.\n",
    "http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/4692-business-intelligence.html\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition 3\n",
    "> Business intelligence (BI) simplifies information discovery and analysis, making it possible for decision-makers at all levels of an organization to more easily access, understand, analyze, collaborate, and act on information, anytime and anywhere. https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc811595(v=office.12).aspx\n",
