# Assignment 1: Environment Setup and Introduction to Python

Run the program `assignment_1.py` from **within your virtual machine**. Do neither run it in a local Python installation nor in a notebook on Azure!

  1. List the all files that this program generates.
  2. Describe which types of files this program generates and attach the contents of each file together with its name to your solution.
  3. What is the output of this program?
  4. Describe in natural language and line-by-line what the program is doing. Describe also for each line what the Python code expresses.


## Hand-in Procedure

  * Create a Markdown (.md) file called `README.md` with your solutions to task 1.-4., see above, in a Github repository.
    * **OBS** You create a markdown document. No MS Word file, no PDF, no other format than `.md`.
  * Your group will work with that repository during the entire course.
  * Hand-in at latest on Sunday 10th Sept. 2017 at 23:59. You will upload a link to the markdown document on Moodle (one link per group).



## Hints:

  * The easiest way to come up and running is by cloning this repository to your computer, create the virtual machine (VM) if you have not done so, log onto the VM, and change to the corresponding directory with this task.
  * To run the program sucessfully you need to be connected to the internet.
  * You can run the program either from the command-line `$ python assignment_1.py` or from within a notebook or the REPL by importing `assignment_1.py` via:
  ```
  import assignment_1


  assignment_1.run()
  ```

  To do the latter the file `assignment_1.py` has to be located in the same directory as the notebook you are working on.
