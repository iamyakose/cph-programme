Grr! Linebreaks do not appear in the comment text!

The premise of the book seems to be that you're going to learn about how to run a startup by reading about successful ones-- that is, you're going to look at a bunch of successful startups, and say Hmm, what makes for a successful startup? 


Another way to put it is that you're trying to train a classifier-- how do you tell whether a startup is going to succeed? Well, if it has a, b, and c qualities in x, y, and z amounts. However, a key part in training classifiers is having negative as well as positive examples. It seems that from reading *just* about successful startups, you could incorrectly infer a bunch of necessary qualities for successful startups, when in fact those are qualities of all startups, or those are just qualities of the sample taken, and focusing on them is bogus. Having no direct experience in the matter, I can't give good examples, but it seems like you could fall victim to a breakdancing chicken problem: (made up example) all the interviewed startups wrote software, so writing software is an important step towards having a successful startups. Well, no, but it just happened that the interviewer focused on software startups. If you had examples of failed startups, you'd see that there was just sampling bias to",,157,,177;454595,,,

(The quality of the internal employee care is less good than it used to be, since back when I started there in 1998, but I could just be bitter after the I/S department layoffs! :-)

Anyway, the whole customer service area is saturated in an ethic of serving the customer. It really is amazing. For example, there are no timers on the calls. Ever wonder why some CSR's are so brusk? Well, they're usually trying to beat the clock. If their average call time goes above some magic number (often as low as two or three minutes) then they get written up by their supervisor. No such problem at Lands' End.

I had to smile that Joel linked to the OCS (The Online Customer Store where he orders his logo'd shirts). I was one of the lead developers on that project. :-)

As for what happens to the returned items? They're sold off in the company employee store for a few dollars. If the company makes stipulations about the use of their logo, then a patch is applied over it, before selling to the employees, to protect the customers brand.

My own experience has been very isolating-I work long hours in the basement of a lab, limiting of my personal growth-I've been in a kind of 'stasis' where I'm in this college environment but very clearly do not fit the mold of a college student, and professionally frustrating - not only do I not have the kind of control over my project which people claim as the holy grail of a Ph.D., there is no clear end in sight to what I am doing.

1) The number beside my user name (top of the page) is a bit confusing.  At first I thought maybe it meant I had some sort of message waiting to be read, or perhaps that I'd made one comment, which didn't make sense because I'd just created the account.  Perhaps a label before the number would clear things up: (karma: 1).

2) I didn't realize at first that the arrows were used for voting.  The main page (http://news.ycombinator.com/) had only &#34;up&#34; arrows.  I figured they were used to collapse/expand additional content, so I ended up inadvertently trying to vote for several arbitrary items (I hadn't created an account yet, so the votes didn't count - I don't think).  Once I saw the &#34;up&#34; and &#34;down&#34; arrows together I got their purpose.  Perhaps, instead of removing one (or both) of the arrows you could simply display a ghosted one?  Or perhaps replace the arrows with thumb up/down icons?

He converted HotOrNot from an S-corporation to a C-corporation.  You can certainly reinvest profits from an S-corporation into the business or pay out profits from a C-corporation as dividends, but the incentives go different ways.  S-corp earnings are taxed as ordinary income (none of the double-taxation of corporate profits) and S-corps can't give out different classes of shares, so there's an incentive to distribute the profits out to the shareholders.  C-corp earnings are taxed once at the corporate level and then once as dividend earnings, yet they can have multiple classes of shareholders.  The incentive is to build up the business and eventually seek an IPO, acquisition, or other liquidity event.

The article has an interesting take on working out the dividing line between founders that are *involved* VS those who are *committed*.  But is this a good enough test?

I found out recently the distinction between 'involved' & 'committed' when a co-founder ditched out prefering to do a Phd (in the exact same area of the product) rather go the hard yards, build a product then sell it. Why? I can only guess. The Phd route could be perceived as less risky, higher prestige over the entrepreneurial route.  Maybe because all the &#34;chicks dig Phd's in CompSci&#34; ?

Using the above test the co-founder would pass. So how do you,  &#34;evaluate if a co-founder is committed over the entire product development timeline before any perceived payback&#34; ?

We are in the era of super-niches; the market we appeal to will get smaller as the competition among startups increase.<p>That said, I would like to propose one &#34;lesson&#34; I did not mention in the article: &#34;As the target niche becomes more narrow, so will the funding&#34;.

950,comment,sharpshoot,1172368210,"Another important thing to realise venture capital is only appropriate at a certain lifestage of a company where the founders are keen to grow at extrodinary rates in a short time. Not having expectations of growing a startup to Facebook, Google or Bebo size you are going to be wasting a VC's time. This is no mean feat - you have to be mentally prepared to grow and scale a company like mad and similarly your startup must have proved its case for being able to scale.<p>Whats the best way to know if your startup is ready? build a prototype, get some traction, look at the numbers, measure, experiment then measure again. If you truly are going to scale (and you are growing at 1% a day) and you've experimented enough that you've found a suitable path you'll end up needing money of the VC scale.<p>It doesn't cost much to sit around and build something. Go and test it - figure out what people want first - change your assumptions and above all PROVE that if you scaled your site it'd be worth it for investors. You don't need VC yet to start something and test it out - If it comes to that point well thats something to think about.<p>I'm reminded of the story Michael Birch of Bebo tells - they built something, put it out there off the traffic of birthday alarm and experimented with features. Every time a feature added to the growth of the site and got a noticeable increase in users they kept it and tried something else which also contributed to the growth. By experimenting, measuring and then iterating for things which correlated for growth they ended up on the right path. When they had 5 million users and were growing month on month they had the numbers to prove themselves. They took $15m from Benchmark capital. The bottom line - you'll know when you are ready: just go prove the numbers. ",,761,,,,,

967,comment,reitzensteinm,1172377825,"Yeah, it's probably not so applicable to consumer facing internet companies since the approach really needs a business to buy into the idea (much more willing to preorder, a single sale could fund the entire development). <p>Although maybe that depends on what you are creating. I could see something like Hotmail or Skype being bootstrapped with this method, because those services are useful to both individuals and businesses. Back then, email from any PC with the internet or free international voice calls would have been things that many businesses would have paid for (and still would, if there weren't so many free alternatives now). Even Reddit got its NYT deal soon after starting which pushed it into the black, did it not? (not rhetorical - I don't know much about their history so tell me if I'm wrong!)<p>There is the problem of loss of focus though. If a company like Hotmail started in '95, realised it could make millions selling their product to companies and focused on that (sales, turnkey servers for easy installation), they would probably only get a few years of that income at most before they are dethroned by a company that just focused on making the best web based email possible. So it would be a bit of a local maxmimum. Is this more dangerous than the loss of focus of doing something totally unhelpful/unrelated to the main product to bring in some cash (contracting, searching for investors) while simultaneously working on the final product?

Thats because they dont search the videos themselves, but rather things associated with them, including the text of a Web page, the metadata that computers use to display or understand pages (like keywords or the semantic tags that describe different content), video-file suffixes (like .mpeg or .avi), or captions or subtitles.<p>None of these methods are very satisfactory. Many Internet videos have little or obscure text, and clips often have no or misleading metadata. Modern video players do not reveal video-file suffixes, and captions and subtitles imperfectly capture the spoken words in a video.<p>The difficulties of knowing which videos are where challenge the growth of Internet video. If there are going to be hundreds of millions of hours of video content online, Mr. Chandratillake said, we need to have an efficient, scalable way to search through it.<p>Mr. Chandratillakes history is unusual for Silicon Valley. He was born in Sri Lanka in 1977 and divided his childhood among England and various countries in South Asia where his father, a professor of nuclear chemistry, worked. Then he studied distributed processing at Kings College, Cambridge, before becoming the chief technology officer of Autonomy, a company that specializes in something called meaning-based computing. This background possibly suggested an original approach to search when he founded Blinkx in 2004.<p>Mr. Chandratillakes solution does not reject any existing video search methods, but supplements them by transcribing the words uttered in a video, and searching them. This is an achievement: effective speech recognition is a nontrivial problem, in the language of computer scientists.<p>Blinkxs speech-recognition technology employs neural networks and machine learning using hidden Markov models, a method of statistical analysis in which the hidden characteristics of a thing are guessed from what is known.<p>Mr. Chandratillake calls this method contextual search, and he says it works so well because the meanings of the sounds of speech are unclear when considered by themselves. Consider the phrase recognize speech,  he wrote in an e-mail message. Its phonemes (rek-un-nise-peach) are incredibly similar to those contained in the phrase wreck a nice beach. Our systems use our knowledge of which words typically appear in which contexts and everything we know about a given clip to improve our ability to guess what each phoneme actually means.<p>While neural networks and machine learning are not new, their application to video search is unique to Blinkx, and very clever.<p>How good is blinkx search? When you visit blinkx.com, the first thing you see is the video wall, 25 small, shimmering tiles, each displaying a popular video clip, indexed that hour. (The wall provides a powerful sense of the collective mind of our popular culture.)<p>To experiment, I typed in the phrase Chronic  WHAT  cles of Narnia, the shout-out in the Saturday Night Live digital short called Lazy Sunday, a rap parody of two New York slackers. I wanted a phrase that a Web surfer would know more readily than the real title of a video. I also knew that Lazy Sunday, for all its cultish fame, would be hard to find: NBC Universal had freely released the rap parody on the Internet after broadcasting it in December 2005, but last month the company insisted that YouTube pull it.<p>Nonetheless, Blinkx found eight instances of Lazy Sunday when I tried it last week. By contrast, Google Video found none. Typing Lazy Sunday into the keyword search box on Googles home page produced hundreds of results  but many were commentaries about the video, and many had nothing to do with Saturday Night Live.<p>Blinkx, which has raised more than $12.5 million from angel investors, earns money by licensing its technology to other sites. Although Blinkx has more than 80 such partners, including Microsoft, Playboy, Reuters and MTV, it rarely discloses the terms of its deals. Mr. Chandratillake said some licensees pay Blilnkx directly while others share revenue and some do both. Blinkx has revealed the details of one deal: ITN, a British news broadcaster, will share the revenue generated by advertising inserted in its videos.<p>For all of Blinkxs level coolness, there are at least three obvious obstacles to the companys success.<p>First, because Google Video is not much good now doesnt mean it wont get better: after all, when Blinkx was founded, it first applied machine learning to searching the desktops of personal computers, a project that was abandoned when Google and Microsoft released their own desktop search bars.<p>Second, even if Google improbably fails to develop effective video search, the field will still be crowded: TruVeo, Flurl, ClipBlast and other start-ups are all at work on different subsets of the market.<p>Finally, Blinkx might not go far enough in searching the content of videos: the company searches their sounds, but not their images.<p>THIS last objection is the most serious.<p>Because Blinkx emphasizes speech recognition, there is a great amount of multimedia content that they cannot address, like photographs, said John R. Smith, a senior manager in the intelligent information management department of I.B.M.s T. J. Watson Research Center in Hawthorne, N.Y. But whats worse, speech is not a very good indicator of whats being shown in a video.<p>Mr. Smith says he has been working on an experimental video search engine called Marvel, which also uses machine learning but organizes visual information as well as speech.<p>Still, at least for now, Blinkx leads video search: it searches more than seven million hours of video and is the largest repository of digital video on the Web.<p>Search is our navigation, our interface to the Internet, said John Battelle, chief of Federated Media Publishing and author of The Search, an account of the rise of Google. With Blinkx, we may have such an interface for digital video, and be a little closer to Mr. Chandratillakes vision of a universal remote control.<p>Jason Pontin is the editor in chief and publisher of Technology Review, a magazine and Web site owned by M.I.T.

Over the past couple of months, however, MySpace has turned greedy. Rupert Murdoch feels that online widgets are a zero-sum game; in other words, widget companies make profit at the expense of MySpace. This couldn&#39;t be further from the truth; the fact is that widgets complement MySpace by giving its users the choice to decorate their pages anyway they want. By restricting access to these widgets, MySpace will not only frustrate the users but also generate unprecedented negative publicity. - Jawad Shuaib",,1030,,,,,

But often I find when very early stage inventors ask people to sign NDAs they often fail to specify what is disclosed even though their agreements require it.  If you ever have to enforce an NDA, trying to argue that the entire conversation was confidential is much harder than simply producing the list of disclosures.
Also, I&#39;ve never asked an investor to sign an NDA.  Asking someone to sign an NDA indicates a lack of trust.  IMO if you don&#39;t trust the people you are talking to you probably shouldn&#39;t be talking to them at all.<p>Recently I&#39;ve been asked to sign NDAs as part of employment interviews.  This seems to have almost become standard practice now. I don&#39;t really think this is a great idea, and I often won&#39;t take an interview that requires an NDA.  But sometimes if I am certain that I won&#39;t be developing my own ideas in the field I&#39;ll sign one.

As I&#39;m sure you can imagine, there have been improvements in the field since then.  To be completely honest, I don&#39;t stay on top of search applied to speech, but the keyword you want is &#34;Spoken Document Retrieval&#34; (SDR).  Ciprian Chelba and TJ Hazen do cool stuff in this area; they are giving a tutorial at ICASSP this year SDR.<p>An aside.  Both of these approaches use the fact that when you process speech, you essentially form a graph of words (or phonemes).  Paths through the graph represent possible transcriptions.  So, since graph is a denser, richer thing to search than the transcript, and we&#39;ve got graph algorithms sitting around, there are neat tricks you can do to build a search engine index for speech...  <p>I&#39;ve recently been reading some interesting work that uses locality-sensitive hashing to search audio.

1181,comment,jwecker,1172496040,"That&#39;s definitely part of it- they are heavyweight threads or processes (no matter how you configure it) (rather than lightweight erlang threads).  I would imagine the bigger problem here, however, is context switching.  Because Apache (and most other servers) use OS threading or forking, the entire state of the current process (let&#39;s say) has to be put aside and then restored later, maybe after only a few milliseconds- because the OS isn&#39;t going to presume anything about the state of that process.  In Erlang&#39;s concurrency model it simply runs 20 (or so, I think- anyway some static number) functions and then goes to another process.<p>Because the functions are, uh, functional there is almost no state to save and restore when there is a context switch.  Also because things like iteration are done with recursion- the 20 functions and then context switch doesn&#39;t get hung up on some loop somewhere.  The faster the OS tries to keep switching between processes, the more overhead it introduces.<p>BTW, this is why in my opinion you don&#39;t see a lot of other systems duplicating this sort of concurrency model- because there are some language &#34;limitations&#34; (recursion only, for example) that make it possible.<p>Most apache, erlang, or kernel hackers would know way more about this than I do, of course.",,1160,,1412,,,

This isn&#39;t always so easy to define.  How many people founded IBM?<p>Despite Thomas Watson being listed as the &#34;founder&#34; of IBM, it is hard to even answer this question since IBM was formed out of the merger of three companies before it was even called IBM.

And while that&#39;s clearly true, it is also true that more founders means more mouths to feed early in the company&#39;s development.  And to run any business you need to learn to manage communication amongst your team.<p>Finally, one has to be careful not to confuse correlation with causation.

1317,comment,trevelyan,1172554993,"I&#39;m not convinced there is much use for this. And there are two fundamental problems.<p>The first problem is the institutional structure of the US education system. In my experience, tech-savvy instructors rarely look for a generic CMS solution. And those without much tech experience resist change unless it is forced upon them because they are already good at what they do and change disrupts their ability to get their jobs done. Blackboard gets around this inertia by selling to university and school administrations, which then push the technology out throughout campuses. It is a top-down sales regime. The company has non-compete clauses so that instructors cannot adopt other systems even if they wanted to. Competing with Blackboard on their own terms would mean wining and dining a lot of administrators who are not going to be interested in beta-testing software.<p>The second problem is more fundamental. A lot of the really interesting stuff happening in the education field is happening with interest based communities like Chinesepod or even open source software projects (for an education in programming...). There are two things that are common to both sorts of communities: #1 they are interest driven, #2 the materials produced are not attempts to solve specific institutional needs so much as address individual &#34;learner&#34; problems. <p>A project like this should be very clear about whether it is serving institutional or learner needs.

They&#39;ve won the war as far as universities are concerned.  However, universities generally do the job of teaching very well.  You also don&#39;t hear of fatal university shootings often (If ever?  I haven&#39;t looked.)  I&#39;m in it to improve the lives and education of high school students.  If I manage to better just one student&#39;s life, then I&#39;ll consider it mission accomplished.<p>High schools are very much open game.  They&#39;re open game because they can&#39;t typically afford the huge sums of money that universities can.  I plan to dominate the low end by creating a product that&#39;s simple, efficient, and inexpensive; something that every teacher would want.  I&#39;m not competing with Blackboard.  I&#39;m sidestepping them.<p>I agree that teachers have methods that they&#39;ve employed for years to teach students.  But part of that is exactly the problem.  When something is done exactly the same for years on end, it gets stale.  A teacher would have -fun- with my product, exploring other&#39;s ideas and communities.  I plan to make them happy.<p>They may be reluctant to use my product, but I plan to be with my two cofounders, on foot, visiting local high schools as soon as I have a feature set that&#39;s useful, and spending time with individual teachers to show them how they might benefit from it.  Then it&#39;s up to the teachers whether or not they&#39;ll use Classbug, but if I&#39;ve done my job well, they&#39;ll most certainly want to.<p>Shawn",,1317,,,,,

Moreover, people read blogs for a reason: they actually want to see all the postings from those blogs, not potentially interesting postings from unknown blogs. Consequently, instead of having a collaborative filtering algorithm, one might use a social network approach. Moreover, rather than recommending individual posts, the user would instead build a set of trusted sources (users and/or feeds) via the social network. ",,1340,,,,,

Even now, most tech savvy people are so used to the omnipresent nature of goole ads that they ignore them by nature.  I can&#39;t even remember the last time I clicked on a google ad or any ad for that matter!  If we add real means to block ads (mozilla add ons for example) to this subconcious rejection of advertising one can see that, in at most a generation, the viability of ad based businesses will be tenuous at best.  <p>Take the example of the Sprint ad which featured 3 guys dancing in the office.  A majority of us watched, a majority probably even liked the ad, but I&#39;ll bet very few switched over.  As technology and information become more pervasive, it&#39;s going to be harder and harder to sell a bad or second class product no matter how good your marketing team is.

1380,comment,Alex3917,1172593943,"It&#39;s interesting to look at the differences between the way Dexter&#39;s doing it and the way we do it. Dexter appears to be lifting his foot straight up off the ground and then falling forward to produce the forward motion. <p>The way humans walk is exactly the opposite. The toes are at a different angle from the foot (when walking), so that our feet effectively look something like ___/ , with the underscores being the foot and the / being the toes. We then transition from the ___ part of the foot to the / part of the foot and push forward, and land flat footed with the other foot. For whatever speed you are going, there is a proper ratio between landing on the ___ part of the foot and pushing off the / part of the foot, and that&#39;s where balance comes from. That is, the faster the acceleration of the fall, the faster you transition from ___ to / .<p>So in humans, balance comes from the way one step connects to the next step, whereas Dexter appears to be treating each step as a discrete unit, where it has to attain balance at the end of one step before going on to the next step.<p>If you actually have to balance yourself after each individual step instead of using the next step for balance, the problem seems in some ways to be much harder. <p>Also, the balance problem is greatly compounded by the small steps Dexter takes. Compare this to doing lunges. When you do a lunge, you basically take a long stride forward and then sink into it, all while keeping your torso perfectly upright. This gives you a much bigger platform for stability. As terrain gets steeper, the way humans walk becomes more like a lunge for this reason. <p>So my guess is that taking one tiny step and then balancing is the hardest part of this problem, because you have the least tools at your disposal. For example, you can&#39;t use the next step to balance you. However, once you can do the last step of the sequence, all the preceding steps working backward from the last one get progressively easier.<p>I don&#39;t know anything about robotics, but as an athlete and sports physiology geek I find the problem interesting.

There are a lot of non-dynamically balanced robots that would just blow the minds of researchers from 20 years ago, but they are still limited.<p>By solving the dynamic balance problem, even though to the untrained eye it may currently look less impressive than some other systems, there&#39;s no more ceiling to what it can do, dynamically (control-wise, not accounting for power density). All of the behaviours you mentioned can be implemented on top of this substrate.

'... here is no equivalent of a model-specific SQL refresh  something that could drop a specific models tables and regenerate the needed SQL automatically ...' ~ true, recognised & being corrected ~ http://www2.jeffcroft.com/blog/2006/jul/20/top-ten-things-suck-about-django. <p>SOME POINTS: Two things come to mind that are not mentioned. The first is hosts. What is the comparison between hosts? The second is how mature the language is. If I want to use python and I need a particular module that does 'fo '. it is probably out there somewhere (though it may be alpha or beta it will most likely out of date) unless you want to re-invent the wheel.  I can't say the same for Rails. Ruby is just a younger language with less code mass.<p>QUESTIONS TO ASK: In the end what really matters is how good the idea & business is. There are plenty of Rail based companies I can think of making a go of it. The same applies to Python based companies. If you accept that technology is an amplifier of ideas, will using Rails or Django alone make a better choice? Is the difference between them compelling enough to make a difference?  One area that could tip in Rails favour is ""susinctness"". But Django with it's python code base has more tools to choose from.

1478,comment,vegashacker,1172644475,"I'm rusty on my Python, but I'd have to guess that no, Python's dynamic features don't get you the kind of power that Pascal's talking about.  The key thing to realize is that any particular feature that your language has doesn't necessarily matter.  For example, Python may happend to have a built-in way of doing<p>(with-input-file (in ""myfile.txt"")
  (do-something in))<p>In Python, this might look like<p>withInputFile in ""myfile.txt"":
 doSomething(in)<p>(hey, I told you I was rusty on my Python...especially my totally made up Python!)<p>So maybe the feature came built-in to Python, in which case you're lucky--Guido happened to decide to implement this feature.  But what if he hadn't?  Well, just write your own abstraction.  Obviously, Python can open files and do stuff with the file's contents.  So it seems logical that you should be able to create an abstraction which saves you from writing the same boilerplate that you do every time you open an input file.  Unfortunately, there are some abstractions that *you just can't write* in most languages (including Python).  This file open example is a good one.  Here's another example, in the form of a programming challenge:<p>In Python, create an abstraction called ""debugExpr"" that consumes an expression E, and then does two things:
  1) prints ""Expression E = V"", where E is the given expression, and V is the value E evaluates to.
  2) returns the value V.<p>For example,<p>%python% 6 * debugExpr(2+3)<p>Expression 2+3 = 5<p>30<p>I'm betting you can't implement debugExpr in Python.  So assuming Guido didn't extend the language to implement this feature, you're pretty much SOL.  It's a shame because debugExpr, I think, is pretty darn useful.  It means that you can take any expression in your code and ""inspect it"", without worrying about adjusting the structure of your program, and without affecting its semantics.  Without debugExpr, I'd have to change my example code to be something like this to get the same result:<p>print ""Expression 2+3 =""<p>tmp = 2+3<p>print tmp<p>6 * tmp<p>

User Interface Libraries, Yahoo! Pipes) . . . but at such a massive company, that code is coming from a very small percentage of its employees, and features such as '360' seem very uninspired IMHO. <p>At the end of the day, there is a disturbing theme throughout this article: give some of our best talent the opportunity to leave the mill and work on something revolutionary, and maybe they won't leave in the first place or keep their ideas secret, and just maybe they won't mind if the compensation is rather dismal compared to what it could be--after all, we can protect them from what so many of them consider the greatest risk: jobless with an unsuccessful startup.<p>Maybe they should ask themselves why they are a mill in the first place?

We thought it would be the perfect place to try to do something like what you suggested: to use a Reddit-like interface to collect comments and discussions on scientific literature.  So Reddit set it up at arxiv.reddit.org.<p>As you can see, there is not much happening.  In fact, the main lesson learned here was not that a reddit-like platform is not ideal to this type of knowledge pooling, but that the scientific community is in general skeptical about this type of information sharing.  We did not require email address validation for logins (hence the spam you can see up there), but we did talk about it with a lot of people and there were good arguments on both sides.  I talked with physicists, biologists and mathematicians about using this type of site, and the replies were mostly those of insecurity about sharing incomplete ideas: both because they might be wrong (and not many scientists like that), and because if they were right, they would rather keep it to themselves and publish it.<p>Actually Paul Ginsparg, the creator of arxiv.org, kind of warned us before we launched that it would take mostly a huge grass-roots effort to get scientists going on something like this.  He was right, and from listening to some of his stories about how he started arxiv.org, it apparently took him over 5 years of grass-roots convincing before it took off, despite being clearly a very good idea.<p>If you are interested in scientific knowledge sharing, with an eye towards collaboration, check out openwetware.org, which uses the mediawiki wiki platform.  Note that they actually do require account authentication, so have a lot less spam issues at this point.  It seems like a wiki platform is more easily adopted for scientists (although still hesitantly), as the subreddit oww.reddit.com, which we tried to push to the openwetware community, has not taken off (this time because of concerns that Reddit is a company.)",,484,,,,,

We have been using Rails for about a year now, and really enjoyed it from the very start because it did so much for us.  Well we have prototyped the idea and would like to start building it for real, and we kept getting caught by Rails when we tried to go against the grain.<p>So we started to look into other web application frameworks, and turned up a lot of comparison between two python-based frameworks, Django and Turbogears, with Rails.  Although they were all very outdated, they all boiled down to using a python-based framework if you want more of the internals exposed (because you have include a lot more code to explicitly specify what you want to do), and use Rails if you don't want these details exposed.  To be fair, you can always dive into the rails code itself to look at the internals, so it is more of a question of how you want your application code to look.<p>As I don't have too much Turbogears experience at this point, I would gladly welcome a re-analysis of the comparison from someone who does.

As I understand it, Reddit is like this: Steve does the coding while Alexis does all the other miscellaneous work.  Sun had 4 founders, but Bill Joy did the programming.  AFAIK, DHH did most of the initial programming for 37signals, though they obviously have more now.  Their advice (in ""Getting Real"") was to start with one programmer, one designer, and one person who could do swing work - a little server admin here, a little CSS work there.  This also squares with Fred Brooks's advice in Mythical Man Month - a programming team should be organized like a surgical team, with one lead programmer and 5-7 people running support so he has no distractions.<p>There're some big advantages to this structure, mostly involving communications overhead.  With one programmer, you don't need to coordinate who does what.  You don't need to explain what needs to be done.  You don't waste time fixing broken interfaces.  You can move quickly and add whatever features the customers want.<p>I've worked for two startups that have both suffered by starting with a team of 4-5 (1 founder + 3-4 employees) instead of a single founder.  It's very hard to get everyone on the same page on the requirements, particularly if the employees don't know the domain well.

But it would totally eliminate people  artifically increasing their Adsense clicks, and if they optimised for the Google income per Adsense view on a site by site basis, then the long tail would effectively be safe from people trying to decrease the rank of their competitors. Not to mention that the data from the long tail would give you an excellent idea of who is being hurt by artifical traffic (you could even use the data from the long tail to rank the main Google search ads which would eliminate the problem entirely, perhaps at the risk of a bit of inaccuracy).",,2082,,,,,

2105,comment,Alex3917,1172977620,"Yes, I'm currently working on two separate books in this application and a bunch of other things. I've found that it actually lets you have more complex ideas than you would be able to have by starting with an outline (or god forbid just freewriting). The idea is that writing should be about ideas, and words are only there to express your ideas. Because of this it doesn't make sense to start putting pen to paper until you figure out what you believe. And it's a lot easier to figure out what you believe what you can drag and drop pure ideas around instead of mucking around with text. <p>Concept maps are another tool that lets you do this, but since writing is fundamentally either flat or hierarchical in terms of how you express ideas, I think mindmaps work better. (Concept maps are essentially like thinking in 3D, which becomes a problem when you need to translate your 3D ideas into 2D writing. Also, a lot of concept maps end up with really murky causality, which kind of defeats the whole point which is to clean up your thinking.)",,2098,,,,,

It's easy to wonder if someone else is working as hard as you if you're the one coding the entire system and they're just supposed to sell it or market it.  I suppose the opposite is true too... how does the non techie know that you're capable of doing what you dream up?  In a relationship that needs to be very trusting, perhaps it's just easier if everyone speaks the same language and works on similar things.  It's also easier to divvy up the money and control if it's obvious to everyone what their role is.",,2038,,,,,

The prediction market was set up in August 2004, and the product that ""had been in the works for a long time"" was scheduled to ship in November 2004. <p>Each ""trader"" received $50 in their account to start with, and was told that the more accurate their prediction, the more money they would make. The market opened with an initial price of on-time delivery set to 16 2/3 cents.<p>""The price of 'before November' dropped to zero right away,"" Proebsting said. ""The price of 'on time' in about two to three minutes dropped to 2.3 cents on the dollar."" Translated, that's more than 30-to-1 odds against on-time delivery.<p>Then the woman who was responsible for scheduling started trying to convince her colleagues who were buying and selling future delivery dates. ""She was able to talk (on-time delivery) up to around 3 cents,"" Proebsting said. ""People really enjoyed moving the price...They loved this.""<p>""The next day the director comes into my office and said, 'What have you done?'"" Proebsting said. But further investigation showed that the product actually was behind schedule, even though nobody was telling management, and it eventually shipped in February.""<p>It is amazing what the crowds are capable of!

2199,comment,Alex3917,1173031510,"Nice article Jeremy. My answer though is none of the above.<p>First, most social networks make just as much money off selling data as they do from ads.<p>Second, all the ads you mention fall into the same category. That is, the product being advertised potentially creates value for the user. So basically the user has to click on the link and buy the product.<p>The most profitable advertising is the type where the ad itself creates value for the user, in addition to the product being advertised. For example, music videos on MTV.<p>Unfortunately all of the social networks in existence today are monetized under the traditional model.<p>The startup I'm currently working on (kitchen table phase) is a social networking thing that actually allows users to manipulate advertising spatially in three dimensions. Of course the user's perspective is completely different, all they see is how the website makes their life easier (and gets them laid) and not how its being monetized. ",,2195,,,,,

What happened to all these sites? Flickr.<p>Flickr was designed around an open API from the ground up, meaning you could take your photos and embed around the web and in other applications. You could even take other people's photos and embed them around the web and in other applications. It was pretty sweet.<p>As a result they quickly dominated the photo sharing scene and were bought out by Yahoo! in record time.<p>Flickr's sustainable competitive advantage was freedom.<p>Back in June the Flickr team was having an internal debate about whether or not to allow competitors to data mine their site. Flickr's founder, Stewart Butterfield, posted a comment on his blog saying, <p>*******<p>""T]his is something that we've never had any set policy on and this thread has sparked a lot of internal debate on the team: some people felt that it was unreasonable, some people felt like it didn't matter since Flickr should win on the basis of being the best thing out there.<p>I actually had a change of heart and was convinced by Eric's position that we definitely should approve requests from direct competitors as long as they do the same. That means (a) that they need to have a full and complete API and (b) be willing to give us access.<p>The reasoning here is partly just that 'fair's fair' and more subtly, like a GPL license, it enforces user freedom down the chain. I think we'll take this approach (still discussing it internally).""<p>*******<p>This makes sense for a non-profit like Wikipedia but it was a bad idea in this case. Flickr made their money by tapping the differential in the freedom gradient, so by requiring reciprocal openness they are literally forcing the competition to steal their sustainable advantage.<p>The paradox is they'd be better off just bending over and taking it. That's pretty fucked up.<p>Or, as Thomas Pynchon says, ""If you can get them asking the wrong questions, you don't have to worry about the answers.""

If one person posts an especially insightful comment, and others recognize it as such, then chances are someone else will repost that comment in future threads about Apple. More and more people come to believe whatever is said, until someone else comes up with a new paradigm for Apple worship. So the discourse evolves, but slowly and in predictable patterns. <p>Certainly any given individual's opinions are constantly in flux, but what matters isn't the ideas of each individual brings to the system, but rather the range of diversity and novelty of thought present in the system as a whole.",,2272,,,,,

Paul Graham, Trevor Blackwell, Robert Morris, and Jessica LivingstonFounders, Y Combinator<p>Rather than sinking a whole lot of money into a handful of companies that may (or may not) turn into the next big Google, venture capital firms like Y Combinator dole out smaller sums to potential mini-Googles. Y Combinator commits to two rounds of funding and dispenses less than $20,000 (expense money, really) to coders so they can work, work, work on a prototype to parlay into more funding. In exchange, Y Combinator asks for 2 to 10 percent of the company's stock. Startups that these guys have funded include Reddit (acquired by CondeNast), Kiko, and Weebly. The names sound funny, sure, but do you remember the first time you heard the name YouTube?",,2323,,2625,,,

An example:  a search for ""blue led 3mm leaded"" returns as its first result an SMD (i.e. non-leaded) part.  What's going on here?  It's matching the phrase ""Leaded Process Compatible: No;"" with a bit of not-terribly-deep semantic matching (leveraging the fact that part specs speak a relatively contrived and regularized language) it should be possible to recognize that ""Leaded Process Compatible: No"" is not a match for leaded.<p>Quibbles aside, I'm looking forward to watching Octopart improve, and, hopefully, succeed.

In a neurological view priming can be seen as the activation of clusters of neurons.

Now the question is how do you think they go about it? My guess is they work from whole to part on a document they find determined by extension/mime type. Then analyse the document in detail for commonly found information (based on  statistical info).<p>I remember reading about how google analysed web authoring statistics ~ http://code.google.com/webstats  For instance 'a' links within html pages which reveal links to other documents can be parsed to extract lots of useful information as found here ~ http://code.google.com/webstats/2005-12/element-a.html<p>But unstructured data is a different beast. How for instance does google work out that 'cm' (what I mean by centimeter) is both 'Columbus McKinnon' and a unit conversion as highlighted in a returned search? [0]<p> One way could be using techniques similiar to the 'Normalised Google Distance' algorythm or NGD. Developed by 'Rudi Cilibrasi' and 'Paul Vitany' (National Institute for Maths & Computer Science, Amsterdam). They build a database model of how close words relate to each other & use this to compute word combinations. The closer the word combinations, the closer the association. So my example of 'cm' would have close association with 'Columbus McKinnon' and 'Centimeter' etc as returned by the google search ~ http://www.google.com/search?q=cm<p>You can read more about this 'Google's search for meaning' [1] and the abstract , 'Automatic Meaning Discovery Using Google' [2].<p>

2747,comment,notabel,1173296924,"QUOTE: Considering that relying sites can filter which providers they allow authentication from, I am overall positive about an increased usage of OpenID.<p>I'm hoping that this sort of thinking will not proliferate, as it nullifies what I see as one of the big advantages of OpenID: user privacy.  The core architecture of OpenID makes it possible for users or small groups of users to operate their own OpenID servers, avoiding the need to hand their personal information over to any third party to prove their (pseudonymous) identity.  If it becomes standard practice to filter OpenID requests to only allow authentication from certain large providers, then OpenID becomes no better than any other single-sign-on system.<p>Moreover, there is no advantage to filtering authentication sources.  An OpenID authentication is merely an assertion that the user is authorized to use a given universally unique identifier.  The only way that the authentication source can cheat is by permitting auths that it should deny, or vice versa.  Because users can choose the authentication source they use, there is no incentive for such cheating.  In the case of a private person running their own OpenID server, the only attack would be for that person to attack their own account, nonsensically.<p>If you're unconvinced of the security of permitting anyone to serve, consider the analogy to Jabber servers: anyone can run their own, federating into the wider XMPP network, and the network maintains security because the misbehavior of one server only affects that server's users.",,2697,,,,,

Like that FizzBuzz program from the post a few days back that a bunch of us spontaneously coded- erase what you did and code it again.  Figure out how to write it in lisp, then erase your code, time yourself, code it again.<p>If it sounds silly, actually try it- you really do gain something.

Honestly I struggled a lot to find confounder because most of my friends are busy with their comfortable life now.  Hence I decided to do it by myself. <p>I am founding company called Onista, which is a Social Marketplace. http://www.onista.com
I am developing everything by myself and I am on pretty good path to release Onista for public use in Summer time-frame.<p>Sorry if I was not clear, but what I meant by ""Early Stage"" was ""Stage at which company releases 1.0 product for public use"".<p>And yes I am in Silicon Valley.<p>Do I have all the required skills? Off course Not, but yes there is one strongest point I have is that I have a lot of determination and persistence. I am willing to learn whatever it takes to get things done.

Useful explains itself (though it's often forgotten); necessary is the real Occam's razor of the group, and perhaps the important one for start-ups (i.e. during the initial angel phase, get your critical functionality implemented--a VC won't be impressed by great features if the core functionality doesn't work); beautiful is tricky.  It's aesthetic.  When it comes to code, though, beauty is usually directly related to maintainability and extensibility.

If every dollar bill in everyone's wallet magically turned into two, the price of everything would double and nobody would be materially affected.  Similarly, doubling everyone's karma and causing the up arrow to give two points rather than one would have no material effect.<p>Inflation matters when you factor in time.  Inflation encourages risk.  It makes your current savings become less valuable in the future, encouraging you to try to increase your wealth to compensate.  Too much inflation encourages too much risk, and you get a bubble.<p>Money is valuable because it can be exchanged for scarce resources.  Karma is valuable because it gets you attention, which is a scarce resource.  There are two kinds of attention: visibility of articles and visibility on the leader board.  Karma is the cause of the latter, but only a byproduct of the former.  There are a fixed number of articles on the front page and a fixed number of spots on the leader board, but both become more valuable as the community grows, because more eyeballs means more attention.<p>At this point, the money analogy breaks down.  Money is both a unit of accounting and a medium of exchange.  Karma is only a unit of accounting.  It tells us how wealthy we are, but we can't exchange it for other wealth.  Attention doesn't behave like a commodity either.  If we give and receive the same amount of attention, that's not the same as simply doing nothing.<p>So, news.yc really doesn't behave anything like a conventional economy.

I would love to have a mentor, but I think that I""m going to branch out on my own to find them, instead of drowning in the crowd at Start-up school to exchange three words with  Jessica or Paul.  Instead, I've been considering volunteering at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View to hang out with some elder geeks.  The Computer History Museum has a bunch of volunteer hardware/software hackers who restore vintage main-frames.  These are all really smart hackers who have spent decades in the tech business, and they are spending time in retirement doing geek stuff, because they love it.  These are the kind of people that I want to spend time with.<p>My team and I just moved to Silicon Valley this past year, and we're setting up out entire lives around the idea of having a series of start-ups.  We've driven a combined total of 12 thousand miles to get here.  We're set up financially so we can afford to iterate through start-up ideas without breaking the bank.  We have a great space to work in, and we're meeting a lot of cool people.

Google has avoided this by applying something known as the ""Lake Wobegon strategy"" (http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2006/03/hiring-lake-wobegon-strategy.html). It states that a company should only hire candidates who are above the mean of the current flock of employees.<p>Though, as I stated earlier, even Google cannot continue to endlessly hire smart individuals.

Get a bunch of people who have never seen your product and don't know much about it, but that are in your target demographic (shouldn't be difficult- a brother, roommate, family of the employees, someone off the street).  Sit them down in front of your product and tell them you're not going to be allowed to answer any of their questions because you're measuring the usability of the system.

3470,comment,Alex3917,1173563592,"The problem: While there are potentially many great co-founders out there, you have no one to work with. This problem has two parts:<p>A) Not knowing enough people interested in startups.<p>B) Not knowing if people would make good or bad co-founders.<p>So this is certainly a step toward solving part A. The problem is it really does nothing toward solving part B, which is by far the hardest part of the puzzle. <p>I'm sitting here reading news.YC and there are comments from dozens of smart people, some of whom would make great co-founders and some wouldn't. The issue isn't for the most part isn't the fact that I don't know they exist; I know they all exist. The issue is a lack of identity. <p>If you want to solve the co-founder problem, the solution isn't to get a large amount of people interested in starting companies in the same room. The solution comes from getting them to know each other. This comes from two things:<p>A) Identity.<p>B) Interaction.<p>Identity is 10% what we say about ourselves, and 90% what others say about us based on previous actions. To solve the identity problem you need a way to either aggregate what others say about us or else shine light on previous actions. (Previous actions being anything from college degrees to old blog posts.)<p>Interaction comes from objects of sociability. Playing games. Breaking a loaf of fresh bread. Sharing a bottle of wine over dinner. A pot of tea. Solving hard problems together. Solving difficult problems together. etc.<p>Anyway, my point is that the website doesn't solve a problem. At best it is the first 10% of the solution that enables a few people with really good judgement to solve the problem themselves. More likely it encourages people to enter really dangerous territory and potentially get into a lot of trouble with people they barely know.",,3441,,3471,,,

News.YC has relevant articles that you can comment on. PG could have just as easily built a site that let you upload your profile pic and interests.<p>The thing is, uploading a profile pic and interests wouldn't let PG know how smart you are or what your personality is like. On news.YC, users are literally creating their own identities through their interaction with the site and with each other. Furthermore, PG designed the site so that users would interact in a way that would reveal the aspects of their character that are most salient to knowing whether or not they'll build a successful startup or go out and blow his money on hookers and beer.  <p>news.YC is the solution to PG's identity problem.

Plus, to a lessor extent, the traits of each individual. (For example, the output of someone working with Steve Jobs is different than their output in other circumstances.) <p>Whether it's more of case 1 or more of case 2 matters when figuring out in which direction to take the community, because in each case you are going to want a different systemic design to bring out the different salient factors.

From my limited experience, talking about your ideas to both laypeople and technical people can only help you.<p>Talking to laypeople helps you solidify and lets you practice pitching what it is that you're doing.  When you're working at a company, you don't have to explain yourself very much.  But when you say you're doing a startup, I've found that most people will demand more of an explanation.  However, most people don't have the patience in everyday settings to listen to more than 2 or 3 minutes of it.  This helps you whittle out the core of what it is that you're trying to build.  Call it a functional spec cleaning, if you want.<p>Talking about your ideas with technical people might give you insight into different areas you're not as familiar with.  The more that I read, the more I realized everything is inter-related.  But it's hard to have that kind of breadth in this day and age of specialization--there's just way too much to know.  Talking to technical people will often times help you make connections and leads to other technical fields that will help you get a feel for where else you can dig or if you're digging in the right place.<p>That said, most people won't steal your ideas for the same reasons mentioned before by others.  Doubts and eagerness to point out how it might not work.  Lack of vision, breadth and depth to understand the problem and implications.  Lack of technical ability.  Lack of time.  Lack of motivation.<p>And after reading and talking to people, it seems like ideas end up changing.  It's only when you're a bit bigger that you'd have to worry about secrets.",,3447,,,,,

3495,comment,lucas,1173581884,"I would say that a lot depends upon the type of product that you're building. For example, if it's a web-based social networking app, send your beta announcement mail to, say, 10 people or 50 people and track views and signups for 2-3 weeks. See what kind of network effect you get. Pick your initial invitees wisely. If you want users, then you want them to be the so-called influencers.<p>I also have this question. I am a little reticent, though, because I'm concerned about scalability. In my case, I am writing the front end in typical database-backed fashion, but the backend is several custom C++ components. So while I want users, I'm not sure how much I want them on day one. Everything I read says, ""get users, figure out your weaknesses, and scale as needed."" That's reassuring. Nevertheless, the unknowns that we face can still be daunting.<p>Larger companies and people who have been around the block will often use a PR firm or will simply file a press release themselves. It costs about $1000, from what I understand.<p>I think from the standpoint of your average bootstrapper, guerilla tactics are in order. I plan on using Google Analytics. I haven't tried it yet, but I plan to. It will, for example, show hits based on geographic location. You can use that to target local advertising in the markets where you're getting some initial traction. I don't think there is really a set approach. When you're a guerilla, anything is possible.

I did some research and concluded two things:<p>1) Be very careful about staying in valid visa status. You don't want to leave the US then come back only to be told you can't enter.
2) Consult an immigration lawyer (I did). It's not impossible to work in the US on a startup full-time, but there are a few issues you should be aware of (said issues might delay you). Our american friends do definitely have it easier though, as they can drop out of school and not get kicked out of the country :)<p>The US does actually provide visas (look up E-2 visas) for people who want to set-up businesses in the States (only for citizens of certain countries). But it does seem that these visas stem from a somewhat antiquated view of what starting a company entails (some of the documents required for an E-2 application are incorporation papers, a detailed business plan, bank statements and other financial documents
showing where the investment funds are from and how much are involved, business lease, receipts and documentation of equipments, supplies, inventories, contracts and receipts, customer/client list, etc.)<p>Anyway, best of luck.

Getting a product out the door is hard. <p>Once it's up, people will judge it pretty quickly, I think. They will look at it, judge it cool and come back, or judge it harshly and never come back again. Sometimes you get a second chance.

http://mealticket.wordpress.com/2007/02/13/demo-day/<p>""..when you think of Facebook as being one of the most exciting companies in the Valley right now and then you realize it's being driven by a young team it makes you question a lot of assumptions. So my 'intended' career path had been law - where your pay and rank is determined purely by the number of years you have worked at the firm for. When you hit a certain age maybe you make partner and maybe you don't. But the point is that age and experience rule in that culture and not raw ability. Why do we have to assume that we can measure the ability to perform well purely by the number of years someone has worked in a particular field? Mark Zuckerberg doesn't have 10 years experience of running companies worth $1 billion but he's doing a pretty good job of it so far.<p>
Why does someone who has spent 10 years analysing financial markets have a better chance of making a success out of an idea we live and breathe everyday? The attitude in the Valley is that your age is determined by the number of startups you've gone through - there are people here my age who have already started and scrapped a couple of companies.

If you read the TechCrunch comments on FreeBase, there are a couple of people who say they had the exact same idea -- one even reserved ""ifreebase.com."" The idea is definitely not new. Facebook wasn't entirely novel either. There are a lot of factors that can make a good idea unprofitable, or a so-so idea a big hit (who knew what AJAX was before it was called ""AJAX""?).
So, yes, your idea may be stolen if it's good. If your idea is obvious, there is a chance that people are just too lazy to implement it. The only way to win in either case, is to work damn hard on your idea until fruitition.",,3447,,,,,

John Carmack, for one, is very highly regarded in the computer science field, but he never went to a prestigious CS school. What I find interesting is that programmers only get prestige from actually DOING something. This can happen at a big company but more often than not it happens at a startup. Lawyers and Doctors 'get' their prestige from going to school and getting their title, whether it is deserved or not, but programmers have to earn it through solving problems.

From 'The HP Way', by David Packard:<p>""Largely because of (Fred) Terman's classes, the four of us - Hewlett, Porter, Oliver, and I (Packard) - became fast friends. It is not a coincidence that a few years later this group would become the management team of HP. Our (Bill and I) common interest in the outdoors first manifested itself in our junior year. There is no question that a shared love of the outdoors strengthened our friendship and helped build a mutual understanding and respect that is the core of their successful business relationship lasting more than a half century.""<p>At the start of Dave's junior year as a Stanford electrical engineer, he demonstrated an interest in ham radios that caught Terman's eye. This led to his invitation to join Terman's graduate course on ham radios, which also included Bill and others, who were crucial to starting and building HP. And the rest, as they say, is history.<p>I hope this story (and the story you have to share) inspires you and the YC faithful, helping you with THE question: how do I find my cofounder? ",,3851,,,,,

They paid for this lawsuit.<p>When you think about it, everything Google does, the Cache, Google Groups, The Image search, and even their golden baby, Search, requires that they deal with the copyrighted material of other people.. It's their bread and butter. They can do it under the law, or at least their lawyers are convinced they can, because of a legal concept known as Common Carrier (Some people in the audience will notice I'm simplifying. I'm trying to encourage discussion, not write a legal essay ;)<p>The Common Carrier clause, written under the (otherwise) dreaded DMCA, says that carriers, such as Earthlink/aol/etc are just carrying information, and they aren't responsible for it.. It provides rules, which say you need to take things down when you're asked, but you're otherwise not culpable- As long as you take it down when asked, you're OK.<p>
Now, with Youtube, before Google invested anything in it,  Google sees a lawsuit coming which could change that.. They KNOW that youtube is likely to be sued, and don't want to have the judge define the laws in a way which screws them over.. They know this lawsuit is coming one way or another, and that Youtube is poor, so their legal defense is likely to..well..suck.<p>Google realizes that if they buy Youtube, they can use their considerable legal muscle and financial capital to DEFEND youtube, and to make sure that they law isn't redefined in a way that screws them.. <p>Since the US system works by a process of Common Law, the precedent is binding. That means that this case will be VERY influential in dertermining any other cases. And it's THOSE that is worried about.<p>THAT's why Google bought Youtube. They want this Lawsuit very badly.<p>Well, As an aside- There's also the line of reasoning that Sequoia Capital was heavily pushing Google for the acqusition.. YouTube was smart/lucky enough to convince Sequoia to invest, which gives Google a good inventive to do the buyout.. That said, I think this was an ancillary factor, not a primary one.

Take baseball for comparison sake.<p>Talent Scout = PG colleague who reviews applications using performance criteria = bank using advanced credit scoring system to approve or reject loans<p>Reddit = Alfonso Soriano = Successful loan applicant<p>Paul Allen = PG = Drew Rosenhaus<p>YC is popular not because they aren't a VC but because they are a VC who provides more perceived value for what they charge.  That means just like IMG, their model is scalable as long as their value proposition is maintained and continues to be favored.  All YC needs to do to fund 1,000 companies next year is to hire/acquire/develop 50 more PGs with specialties in more focused markets and sub-markets.  Not simple but definitately doable.  Also fully automate the application and evaluation process so that ""people"" only touch the top 3%.  Continue to be careful with funding amounts but generous with time and connections.  Continue to distribute and increase your value through your customers by financing their meeting each other and adding value to each other.  Basically, YC is a social network with most of the value right now distributed offline through their customers.  News@YC will change that to be sure.  I think it's not only possible to grow up real big, but the direction you are already headed.  Just make sure your scalability has a bit of Ben & Jerry's thrown in, they did a great job of keeping their value system in place long after they grew.  PG, you mentioned it's the scaling of the partners responsibilities that is hard.

How about inserting a clause in your funding agreement?

I don't think there's an easy answer to that one.  You may need to expand your partnership....<p>The question for me is:  are there even 1000 companies worth funding every year?

Unlike implementation, specification -- at least at an informal level -- can be done by pretty well anyone.  Of course, you will need to provide some way to end up with a coherent spec from all those user contributions. But if something like wikipedia can produce stellar results, then why not this?<p>And when you start working on something, why not keep all those people up to date with your progress? They would probably be very eager to see what you are doing with their spec contributions.

I'm assuming all of us here aren't interested in opening up a mini-mart (rather we're interested in startups in the PG definition of the word -- basically something that scales).  And yet, the ""over half"" figure that's quoted in the article I'm sure includes things like mini-marts.  And I would guess that a mini-mart business has a better chance of staying open over a year than a tech startup does.  So the ""over half"" might be inflated in the other direction. <p>Also, I wonder if companies that in reality fail before one year might just tend to wait until the next tax year comes before officially shutting it down with the government.

4059,comment,nostrademons,1173847506,"There was some study - I think it was linked to on Dharmesh Shah's blog (onstartups.com) a month or so back - that indicated the success rate for first time entrepreneurs in VC-funded tech startups was 18%.  For entrepreneurs with a previous failure it was 20%, and for entrepreneurs with a previous success it was 33%.<p>I suspect that the success rate is somewhat higher for bootstrapped tech startups, because you're given the option of failing and trying again with the same company, different idea.  Usually if you fail with a VC's money, they liquidate the company.  If you fail with your own, you can take the assets you have and try to redirect them to a new line of business.<p>I thought I saw another study somewhere that said that the average number of failures a bootstrapped startup goes through is 4.  That squares with the success rates for VC-funded startups above, if you assume that each failure simply means the entrepreneur tries a new idea.  You have a 18% chance of succeeding on the first try, a 33% chance of succeeding by the second try (82% * 82% = 67.24% chance of failing), a 45% chance of succeeding by the third try, and a 55% chance of succeeding by the fourth try, for an average of 3-4 attempts necessary before success.",,4055,,4068,,,

The future leaders of the social web will analyze the strengths and weaknesses of today's leaders:  Google, Facebook, Myspace, Del.icio.us, Wikipedia, and Craigslist. (technology increases exponentially: never forget this)<p>When a website incorporates all the positives of these types of websites into 1 all encompassing tool for organizing the unlimited information of the Internet, then we will see something great.  We will see an evolution of these tools and it will not only be something people can use to get more efficiency out of life, it will actually improve people's lives and societies (globally).  <p>If you think the effects social networks and human/computer interaction are amazing, wait until you see the children of these sites.  It is  *absolutely* not a coincidence that the founders of Reddit played WoW.  They realize that power of a website is directly correlated to the amount of user input into a website.  The dilemma we entrepreneurs are faced with today is creating systems that encourage maximum participation.<p>How does this tie into the 53,000 theory?  None of the big winners, and I am talking the big ones, facebook, myspace, google, msnpages, orkut, (these are the sites that lead the world in user participation) succeeded because of blog recommendations.

Humans are economical; they do what is best for themselves.  When we create a search/browsing tool that is at the same time more rewarding and fun than myspace/wikipedia/delicious/digg we will see the whole world adopt this method, the same way the world has adopted the Google search, the same way all the ÃÂcoolÃÂ people are on myspace.

4244,comment,nostrademons,1173907581,"Reading and keeping up with the news is kinda odd.  99% of what you read is absolutely useless.  It will never make a difference in what you do, and you'll probably never use it.  However, that remaining 1% can save you *huge* amounts of time or open up massive opportunities.<p>Just a couple examples where procrastination has changed my life.<p>When I was 16, my family went shopping at the Tanger 2 supermall in Riverhead NY.  I hate shopping.  So, I did what I normally do: I found a bookstore, grabbed an interesting book, curled up on the floor, and read half of it by the time my parents got back.  On that particular occasion, the book was ""Learn Java 1.0.2 in 7 days"" or some other tripe like that, the year was 1997, and the Java wave was just taking off.  One book led to a second and third, and then a whole shelf full, and eventually an internship at MITRE corporation.<p>While on the job, I was asked to learn Perl.  A couple years later, immediately after high school graduation, my math teacher's wife was starting a company and had an immediate need for some Perl programming.  In the year I spent at that company, I got to experience a dot-com run exclusively by teenagers, 3 different business plans, all the tribulations of a startup, and eventually an ugly VC takeover.<p>While slacking off at that company because I had no work to do, I found Fanfiction.net and the Harry Potter fandom.  I read a whole bunch of fics, then my workload picked up again and I promply forgot about it.  I went back to it during college, and ended up joining FictionAlley.org, which was just starting at the time.  Over the 4 years that I volunteered for FA, I saw it grow from 2,000 registered users to 100,000 registered users, from one machine to three, had my first experience managing teams of software developers and got to take my first major project from conception to completion.<p>Separate thread - at an internship after my freshman year, I was goofing off at work and reading Ward's Wiki.  I ended up getting pretty involved in housekeeping there after the internship ended, and struck up a few friendships.  One of them led *directly* to the startup I'm currently employed at, via a couple of internships.<p>Now that I'm co-founding a startup of my own, I'm finding that all the different internships and threads and so on pull together.  I know what to expect in terms of growing a community.  I've had experience with 2-3 different technology stacks (and found they all suck ;-), but at least that led me to one I'm reasonably happy with).  I know all about scaling concerns and breaking an app out over multiple boxes.  I've got some experience in judging whether a business model will fly or not.  (I think our business model sucks, BTW, and really doubt it'll get us off the ground, but we've gotta start somewhere.)<p>All of this came, in some way or another, from procrastination.<p>Incidentally, running a startup seems much the same way.  The vast majority of stuff you do is worthless, but the 1% that pays off really pays off big.  Unfortunately, you have no way of knowing what that 1% is until you try it.  People talk about how Bill Gates got lucky with the IBM deal - the thing is, Microsoft had a zillion balls in the air at the time, and if they hadn't gotten lucky with IBM they might very well have gotten lucky elsewhere.",,4202,,4247;4246,,,

His point is that in order for a new idea or product to catch on, it first needs to be adopted by the ""innovators"" -- the ""geeks"".  Then, and only then, can it spread to the broader population.

This is a key point- Look what Adobe has done with Acrobat- It's a great format, but for YEAR it got slower with each revision..
If this happens with Flash, there's nothing you can do about it.

There it's like 200$ total.  For a start-up, you normally don't need a whole lot of ""lawyer juice"" in the equation.  The forms are very simple.  You basically fill out the articles of incorporation document, then fill out a listing of officers/board members (initial listing of officers), which can be changed later.  You also need to have a resident agent, which doesn't need to be a physical place, so long as lawsuit stuff can get there.  Many places offer resident agencies as a service for as little as 99$.  The deputy just needs to be able to deliver you some lawsuit/whatever.  You send it all off to the secretary of state in whatever state you wish to incorporate, then in a few weeks later you get a copy of the forms back plus a certificate signed by the secretary of state saying that you're incorporated under that state.  Normally all states have a website where you can look up information about a particular corporation.  Every year you have to pay a few hundred bucks or so to rewnew the initial listing of officers.  It gets a little more complex if you have investors and the company is initially shared between several people/other companies, but overall, its really that simple.  <p>

The process is pretty easy for the TN-1 Visa, if:<p>1) You have a degree in a professional field (Software engineering, Computer Science, etc.)<p>2) Your employer can provide you with a letter confirming that you fit their requirements and will be employed for 1 year at X$ (the visa is renewable yearly) and is employing you in a field that is related your degree and expertise.<p>I am a Canadian and I just needed to go to the airport, just before leaving, and show the required documents (passport, diploma, grades, letter from employer) and for a small fee, I think ~80$, they give you a visa good for one year. Once there, you can apply to receive your social security number, etc.<p>Note that the TN-1 Visa doesn't work if you are planning on being self-employed or entrepreneur in the USA. The people at the border want to see that your employer will pay you and that you need to go there because you are highly qualified for the position. The visa is also voided if you leave your job to take another job or being self-employed.",,4458,,,,,

This project wasn't really a failure per se: it's in production now, people use it, and FictionAlley's still getting 350 or so simultaneous users.

It seems to me that for Adsense the revenue of 1,197mm this quarter had a 'Traffic Acquisition Cost' (i.e. what they pay to website owners) of 975mm, so they see very little profit from that. <p>Without search, this quarter, Google would have been 947mm in the red instead of 1030mm in the black. Without Adsense, which is 37% of their revenue, they'd have lost just 222mm from their bottom line.<p>In contrast, Microsoft's biggest earner in 2006, Office, had a revenue of 14,488mm without which they'd still be in the black by 3774mm pre tax.

For example, if your app uses complex queries with a lot of joins and subselects, Postgres optimizer will likely give you significantly better performance than MySQL's, regardless of whether it happens to be running on a VPS.

Nokia tried to make a software program that would let you find your friends, and they could only make it work on seven or eight of their OWN phones. Yahoo has search software that works on many models of phones, but they also have 100 hackers employed to work full time on just that. You won't have 100 people.<p>2) The cell phone carriers turn off parts of the bluetooth spectrum to prevent people from downloading their own ringtones. This also prevents people from using your software if it needs bluetooth.<p>3) Cell phone carriers will never partner with you. At least not on terms that allow you to make a profit.<p>4) Even if one cell phone carrier partners with you, the rest won't.<p>5) Any software that takes advantage of the phone feature will drain the battery very fast. If you need to ping the cell tower ever five minutes, that means you have to recharge the phone every two hours. Which essentially means the phone is now worthless for making calls.<p>6) Most people don't know how to load software onto their cellphone, even if they were willing to pay for it.<p>7) Even if you can get some people using your software on their phone, to everyone else it will just look like they are sending text messages. If no one can see others using your software then it isn't viral and it won't spread.<p>8) Cell phones don't fit into the pockets of girls pants. (This is actually a serious problems)<p>9) There have been hundreds of entrepreneurs who have gone into mobile, and they have all failed. I can name two dozen companies that have tried to do social networking over cell phones.

Connecting to them and finding ways to build an identity within the community are the main activities. If you're applying social networks in way that ties in with people's identity then you can have a lot of socializing without a lot of features. If you're (mis)applying a social network to a topic that has nothing to do with people's identity then you're going to have to build in a lot of other activities.<p>I think it's a big boon that Ning decided to focus just for the fact that it helps define the market.

XUL is there not as a feature but as a tool: the FF UI is built with XUL.  That it is useful for others is really just a detail.  In FF3, there will be more emphasis and support given to XUL apps, but still, it's there for the browser.<p>Also, the degree of competitions between FF and Apollo is, I think, overestimated.

5136,comment,xinroman,1174372502,"I've had this discussion several times with one of the early developers of del.icio.us. It is by far one of my favorite web tools, and I think one of the most useful things about it is the way that it encourages a sort of conversation between its users (ie, someone can send a bookmrak to me, which of itself, begins a sort of dialogue between us, or can write a description in the notes taht I know is intended for me). What I find disappointing sometimes is that when this happens there is no way for me respond to them directly about the link (you can send messages to another user, but then you lose a lot of the context). The most obvious answer would be to allow me to comment on other users' bookmarks or ""send"" them a message back about the bookmark they sent me. The explanation I keep getting when I say this is that they didn't want to distract users or muddy the purpose of the app by turning it into another blogging tool. Ultimately, I think they made the right choice not to add this feature. It keeps it clean and useful while still allowing for self expression within the core of the application. I would probably like Digg a lot more if I weren't so damned distracted by all of the threaded comments that follow each post, most of which are completely useless.",,1249,,,,,

5141,comment,brett,1174374568,"In principle I agree with what he is saying: If you know what you are going to need you should put in effort up front so you can react faster later. The problem is with knowing what you are going to need. You hear that startups end up moving away from there initial ideas so often that bar for being sure that you ""know"" what you're going to need is very high. <p>I also think he overstates the difficulties of abstracting out extensible pieces as you go. His point about your # of customers being proportional to the difficulty of refactoring is well taken, but for an early startup this probably does not mean as much as he suggests. On the web you can do a great deal that is transparent to your customers. The risk of this approach might lie more in not having to discipline to take the time to refactor as you go as opposed to not having the technical ability. 37 Signals seems to have had certain project go very well for them by pushing down abstractions as they went (granting however, that everyone can't count on a gang of open source hackers coming in and both contributing to and evangelizing your product's infrastructure - though maybe this isn't a bad goal?).

I didn't see an easily-accessible feedback link (note to other startup founders: include this), so I'll post my feedback here:<p>1. Congratulations.  In two days, you have managed to create a community more fucked up than YouTube.<p>2. I started watching <i>because</i> of the outrageous stuff other viewers were doing.  When you go to curb the abuse, be aware of this.  Many of your viewers may be watching only because folks are doing stupid stuff like ordering pizza and making yCombinator pay for it.  Lose the hassles and you may lose the audience.<p>3. Reality TV shows succeed because they're <i>unreal</i>.  TV execs hype up and dramatize all sorts of conflict, because that's what gets viewers to tune in.  Nobody wants to see an ordinary person's life, because it's <i>boring</i>.<p>4. Who do you want to be - Anna Nicole Smith or Paris Hilton.  Your success in attracting viewers is proportional to how trashy you are willing to become.  Anna Nicole Smith and Paris Hilton remain media darlings because we can look at them and think ""Wow, look how pathetic they are.""  It makes us feel good about ourselves.  Unless you are similarly pathetic, people will not want to look at you.  Respectable people like Tim Berners Lee or Steve Wozniak seldom end up on the news.<p>5. If you <i>are</i> respectable and still choose to go on reality TV, you're setting yourself up to be torn down.  The justin.tv tagline is accurate: ""An exercise in narcissism"".  Narcissism is going to prompt abuse.  People think that since you've set yourself up on a pedestal, you've given them an opening to tear you down.<p>6. I initially had logged in watch the yCombinator dinner.  That proved impractical because of the technology: the audio quality was shitty, the video would randomly drop out, and you couldn't really see anything anyway.  Part of the problem for attracting a decent community is there's nothing for <i>decent</i> people to do.  That leaves it as a festival for troublemakers.<p>7. Have you guys not read Shirky?

Kyle was bragging about his 1337 MIT CS skillz in the chatroom.  Emmett was talking about their being only a finite number of attack vectors, and he'd have them all patched in a week.  In my experience, <i>never</i> underestimate the clever things people will do to break your system.  People will still be finding ways to abuse it a year from now, assuming it still exists.  The arrogance is just an invitation for them to try harder.<p>9. I won't be back, mostly because this is a complete waste of time.

5331,comment,reitzensteinm,1174466593,"Actually, it can work on the same principle as PPC, except the $/click takes time to work out (you have to send traffic to the site to determine how much revenue it gets you). Analagous to your example is Amazon biding $0.00001 per click - they would simply be outbid by sites willing to pay more for the keywords. The only difference is that with PPC there's a minimum - I think it's 5 cents, though it might have increased to 10 - but you can define an action as an extremely infrequent event. But that difference only comes into play when you've got no competition, and if you've got no competition for a keyword, it's extremely unlikely that it's going to be a lucrative one.<p>The key point is that Google figures out how much it makes by sending people to a site, and ranks the sites based on that metric.

I guess in this case you're not paying based on the actual value of the sale, you're paying based on what you bid as the actual value of the sale... <p>I see this as Google getting into the affilate marketplace, and integrating the adwords buying (which many many many affiliate marketers use) and affiliate payout into one financial transaction. <p>Hmmn, thinking about this more, it's actually cutting out the middlemen in a vast number of affliate transactions-- those that are entirely reliant on adwords buys instead of eyeballs coming in through a particular publisher. Now you can buy affiliate clicks on Google's entire network, instead of cutting individual deals with lots of sites and dealing with the administrative overhead of managing affiliates.<p>Smart.

They assume that it'll pay off in the long run(whether that be buying tracks on itunes, getting a cd or a tshirt at their show). Just because the current model for selling music isn't working and piracy is a popular alternative doesn't make music worth nothing.<p>Also, any band already relies on live concerts for their means of money. This is nothing new. What is happening is that major labels are getting a bigger piece of the pie when it comes to merchandise(which used to go straight to the band).

This is glaringly obvious for music, and we're headed that way for film. <p>The film industry will do it's best to stay ahead of the bandwidth: 3D projection, better surround sound, etc, but will also need to adapt to make formerly secondary revenue streams (product placement, franchise merchandise, etc) more primary.

5605,comment,python_kiss,1174535789,"Dan, thank you for sharing that awesome list. Joel's recommended books are great; in fact, back when I was developing a micro ISV, I used to turn to Joel's website for advice. That is where I discovered Paul Graham's ""Hackers and Painters"". Since then, I have shifted my allegiance to a new mentor :) I think the book brought three major changes in how I think:<p>1. Think big: Since I was developing a micro ISV, I had never really considered scaling the business to millions of customers (aka users). ""Hackers and Painters"" entered my life just a few weeks before I was about to launch my product; and I realized I had to develop something that can scale. I took a leap of faith and decided to instead pursue web startups; the opportunities for growth were many times in magnitude.<p>2. There are others like me: Toronto, Canada is not exactly a Silicon Valley. So uptil then, I didn't know there were so many other young entrepreneurs pursuing the same goals as me. Eventhough I wasn't acquainted with other hackers, I could at least gain a sense of security that I am not alone.<p>3. The Art of the Start: The single most valuable lesson I learned from Paul's book was the governing dynamics of web startups. Before reading it, there was not much inspiration or reason to think big because even if I did venture into online startups, I wouldn't know what to do.<p>
While I have read some excellent books, I can credit Paul's work for watering the first seeds.",,5576,,,,,

Most business books are fun to read, but it's really hard to say that any have been truly helpful.  Most lean more to the motivational/inspirational side, instead of focusing on case studies.  My suspicion is that business is probably not best learned from a book.  But I'll list a few I like anyways.<p>Alan Sugar: The Amstrad Story
  - Great story about how Sir Alan grew an empire selling stereos out of the back of a car.  Instructive because his key insights revolved around understanding what the average user wanted, as opposed to the technical elite. <p>Softwar:  An Intimate Portrait of Larry Ellison
  - He started his first company at 33 after working for other high tech firms.  This book is neat because Ellison adds his own comments in the footer when he disagrees with the biographer.<p>Founders @ Work
  - Pre-ordered it.  I was tempted to read it all at once, but decided to spread it out over 2 weeks.  I'm glad that I did - there's a lot to digest....<p>Product side:<p>
<i>Designing Interactions
   -  If you want to design great user experiences, it helps to see the thought processes great designers go through to create successful products.<p></i>Bulletproof Web Design
   - Well written, concise.  Cederholm knows CSS.<p><i>Hardening Linux
   - I've seen many guides at the bookstore.  This one appealed to me because it has both breadth and depth.  The chapter on configuring firewalls was alone worth the price of the book.

5793,comment,capoeirista,1174598490,"This is an interesting question, and as a girl geek who is applying to y combinator and has worked for many startups, I can mention a few things. <p>1) Startup culture appears to be a boys' club.  <p>a) Have you ever noticed that when you hire the first woman in any company, the dynamic changes? There's resistance to that change, whether it's for better or worse. (pun intended) There's a big sign on your clubhouse that says [GIRLZ KEEP OUT!] Sometimes it's very subtle. Sometimes overt. How many of you actually had women on the short list of people you were choosing to partner with? Some geeky guys still have a hard time talking with girls. It may be an issue with whom you're comfortable sharing your great idea. From what I've read in these posts, you have some assumptions that you're making about girls. Truth is, when you get to a certain level of skill or creativity, assumptions need to fly out the window - for both men and women. <p> b) With that being said, I love it when work consumes me with a passion and takes all of my time to the exclusion of all else. I have mad skills in a bunch of different areas and startups seem to want me. . . but they don't think of me as a co-founder. I code, design, do market research, marketing strategy, media buys, infrastructure, pitches. . .  basically I've worked for many startups doing everything necessary to get started. Still thought of as an accessory - never fully included. My solution to this has been to position myself differently - and I can do that now. I need to market my skills differently from the way guys do. This has been successful. <p>2) We're not as sensitive to hierarchies and heirarchies' flip side, competition, as guys are. <p>a) We often just want to get it done. We don't care as much if it strokes our ego or your ego. It needs to be done. If, every time we have a conversation, it becomes a zero sum game of who wins the dominance, it's stupid. <p>If there's a list of things that need to get done on the table, and some tasks are seen as too onerous for guys' job descriptions (egos), we wind up doing it because it needs to get done. Because we did it, somehow our status falls. We wind up getting stuck with _all_ the crappy jobs, and it winds up sucking for us as our status continually sinks. <p>b) We assess ourselves and our skills differently. Here's an illustrative example. A female engineer once told me why she gave up working in industry. She was the only woman working with a team of guys. The team lead would throw out a task for discussion on the table. Everyone but she would say they could do it easily. She would say that no, this has these challenges and would take much longer. One of the guys who said that it was easy would get the project and then go to her for help doing the problematic tasks. Who got promoted? The guy. Who was doing all the hard work? She was. Female examiners at the patent office tell the same story. There are a lot of women engineers who leave industry because they can assess themselves and the problems accurately and this isn't valued. Managers want their problems solved. They value gung-ho over truth.<p>c) This is often linguistic. Men and women use different syntax to express the same thoughts. I need to remap what makes sense to me onto another linguistic pattern and that seems to be a waste of energy. In fact, this has a lot of benefit because it makes us better communicators all around. It's a learning curve - and it's often hard to recognize that it's there or needed. (I was a linguistics geek in college, where I found out that 85% of all conversational interruptions occur men on women, so it's a challenge for us to get a complete paragraph size thought into a conversation - much less complete a sentence without being completely stepped on.) <p>But even in the more egalitarian parts of the States, there are different linguistic patterns for men and women. If you go to the South, it's much more amplified. If a woman makes a statement with the same intonation and wording as a guy, the conversation just stops for a hot minute while everyone in the room processes it. In places like Alabama, I need to preprocess so that the communication is seamless and the conversational stoppages don't occur - and this often means using what would be considered subservient speech, like ending a statement with a questionmark. Up north, if I'm in a roomful of guys, or even just talking with one, the preprocessing still needs to happen. <p>        d) It may be that because we're not as sensitive to hierarchies and have different sensibilities about status, money means something fundamentally different to us. <p>        e) When I was in college, I really wanted to go into physics, and I was good at it. I spent a summer working for NASA and saw how cutthroat the competition was among the physics geeks and didn't like it. Several years later, I was the webmaster for a hearing research center at a big university. It was a collection of twenty or so labs. I noticed that there were a lot of female scientists, that there was a lot of collaboration between scientists in this particular center and also around the world. I decided to find out what was so different and spent about a year asking people how it came about. <p>The story is interesting. It wasn't by accident. It turns out that at MIT thirty years ago, there was a hearing research professor who got all of his grad students together and told them that their careers didn't have to be all sniping and competitive - that they could do something different and agree to cooperate. These grad students are now the heads of their own departments. They teach their undergrad and grad students what behavior is acceptable and are growing a culture of deep respect and cooperation. It has a lot of benefits for hearing research as a whole. Work isn't hidden from each other and duplicated - meaning money and time isn't wasted - so it's much better for the hearing research discipline. There isn't the attitude of hoarding ideas for credit. Everyone's resumé has long lists of collaborations. Mostly, everyone's really happy and nice. Apparently, vision research is the exact polar opposite. <p>I know that in a free market society, competition is seen as creating efficiency, but in a lot of ways, it's very wasteful because of hoarding of ideas and duplication of effort. For people who don't have access to resources, cooperation results in significantly greater value. There isn't nearly as much money available for hearing research, but these researchers are incredibly efficient because they eliminated the competition from the discipline. They're still evaluated. They still have to do their work and be very good at it. It's just that the element of fear is gone. <p>Alpha males and alpha females see competition differently. How many alpha males can be in a company at any one time? Those who aren't the tiny percent of you who are alpha males feel fear when there's excessive competition. Do you want to work in a fearful environment?<p>    3) If we're single and cute, the dominant chimp will hit on us unless he has a well developed sense of morals. I've been around and around with this one with other women about what to do in response to this and have seen a lot of different strategies to handle it. Some women just shut down their levels of expression and passion for their work. (sucky solution) I know one woman who pretended she was a lesbian. (sucky solution, but one of the most successful - she still retained respect) This comes up a lot at female executive dinners. It's tiresome because when the dominant chimp's ego's bruised there's _always_ retaliation of some form. <p>4) It may be that y combinator and the VC game doesn't get us where we want to be. <p>a) If the majority of all small businesses in the States are being started by women, and if we're especially good at communication and customer service, which you'd think would be great for Web 2.0, then what is it about the whole VC game that doesn't get us there? How are we starting our businesses without you? When we're starting businesses, what's the structure like? What kinds of businesses are they? <p>b) I know that usually VCs or angels don't even look at people until they've spent $50k of their own money. Women have a harder time coming up with funds like that. We still don't have wage parity. We're taking care of our parents or our sister's kids. It's harder for us to get out of family obligations. In the family, daughters are still thought of differently. While I was still an undergrad, I was a founder in a startup. I had to leave to take care of my sick mother. When I asked her if I were a guy, would she have asked me to give up my business, she replied, ""no."" without any hesitation. We're still expected to do the bulk of non-market labor in this culture. If we say no, there are repercussions. Being a good girl is always for someone else's convenience. <p>c) It may be a timing thing. Women may have different goals immediately after college. It would be interesting to check to see how old the women are who are starting businesses in this country. I'd want to check the distribution graph - don't just look at the mean or median ages of when they're starting businesses - I bet there are several humps on it - each would tell a different story about that group's lives. By excluding women who are above a certain age, you're cutting out a lot of experience and wisdom. One of the coolest businesses was started by Mary Kay. However cheezy her pink Caddies are, she had a lot of insight into how women ran their lives and built her cosmetics distribution model on those insights.<p>d) I'm willing to bet that women are starting businesses with less, are entering businesses with lower barriers to entry in general, and that the geeky women aren't starting businesses or aren't going your route to do it. If you look at the percentage of female college grads in engineering and the sciences, it's a much higher percentage than who are applying to y combinator. How are their opportunities and thoughts different? Perhaps you should ask them. You're missing a lot of talent by not addressing it. Are there qualities that you are rewarding that talented women find reprehensible or icky?<p>By definition, you're looking for special people. The next Teslas are going to be odd no matter where they're from or what their gender is. What would have happened to Tesla if there had been no viciousness of Edison's smear campaigns? Clearly the world lost out. (I have a thing for Tesla, and in an ideal world, Firefly would still be on the air.) <p>If the next Tesla is currently wearing a burka in Afghanistan, she, and the world, are out of luck. If she's in school just down the river, or has just sent her kids off to college, you may be able to do something about it if you want to. ",,3574,,,,,

If your audience is a million working girls your best response comes from more strident stuff. Since there are so many more working girls versus rich wives, it seems as if all DM is ""downmarket"". I am sure of this because I've seen the difference even a few changes can make, and I've seen years and years of real-world research on how different styles gather response for different things.<p>Let's say I'm doing an ad for big copiers.

They are designers trying to create something unique, trying to find a spark.  When successful, it's usually a small crowd that ""gets it"": they're passionate about it while many, maybe even a majority, hate it.  If it's truly good, eventually the majority gets converted.  I'm in the majority with the Honda Element, for example: to my shock I'm beginning to come around.<p>Most edge design, though, IS ugly, will gain only hedging admiration from the designer's mother and averted gazes from his wife.

When it is right it pays 10x, or $500,000.<p>exp(strategy 1) = prob(x)<i>x - 0x = (0.9)</i>0 - 0 = 0<p>exp(strategy 2) = prob(x)<i>x - x = (0.1)</i>10 -1 = 0<p>So if we only have a 10% success rate and a 10x payoff, we might as well be sipping tequila on the beach.

If these two companies are fighting for share of a tiny pie, it's just stupid.  If the pie is much bigger than I believe it is, then the game for market share hasn't even begun yet.  The big players haven't even really placed their bets, and that's when things will get interesting (but you have to be there before the big players if you want a chance at walking away a big winner).<p>Anyway, it's not a market I'd want to go after, because I don't see it being big enough for so many contenders (there are others out there--it's not just these two).  But then, almost no market looks big ""enough"" to outsiders.  People are always confused when I make claims about how large our market is (niche software for a 10-20 billion dollar worldwide industry that's increasing at a couple billion per year).<p>So, if they've researched their market and found it large enough to make for big winners in a year or two, now is a fine time to enter it.

6075,comment,Alex3917,1174747369,"Sociologically, twitter is very different from other communication forms. AIM and Skype are designed for communicating thoughts and ideas. Twitter, however, is designed for telecocooning. Telecocooning is traditionally defined as sending little ""presence pokes"" to people. For example, just saying hi or sending someone a picture of a heart or a smiley face. The point of these messages isn't the ideas they contain, but rather the message itself. That is, just getting any message from someone shows that the other person is thinking about them and cares about them.<p>Traditionally people telecocoon with their two or three closest friends. However, Twitter lowers the telecocooning barrier so you can telecocoon with many more friends for the same effort. People tend to just send messages like ""ahh homework sucks"" or ""heh stuck at the library."" You aren't really communicating anything intelligent, but you are building a feeling of group solidarity by letting people around you know what's up. It also helps people to find where their friends are if they want to meet up.

6140,comment,Alex3917,1174825975,"Great speech. My only comment is on the idea that we will look back on professionals as being like serfs. As Paul mentioned earlier, what is driving people into the service of others is a combination of social status, risk avoidance, and the need for ""structure.""<p>I don't think risk avoidance and need for structure will ever change. The real question is whether our conceptions of social status will change. So I've been writing a lot recently about how organizations and institutions exploit people's need for social status in order to secure cheap labor and make money. <p>The most obvious example is how WoW literally allows you to ""level up."" Even though objectively you are just spending 12 hours a day clicking on pictures of digital rats on a computer screen, qualitatively it's designed to make you feel like a hero. Everyone wants to be a hero in real life, but most people are just too lazy or untalented or risk adverse. It's not fair, but that's the way it is. Organizations have figured out how to tap into people's need to ""be the hero"" while extracting cheap labor (or purchases) from them. <p>A good example is when I was learning to play the trumpet. Learning to play a musical instrument is a very slow and continuous process. If my trumpet teacher were to have said, ""ok, today you are level one trumpet. ok, now you're level two trumpet. etc."" I think most people could figure out it's a scam. Improving at trumpet is a continuous function, not something that happens in levels.<p>The thing is, when people say, ""ok, you're level one at education, you're level three at business."" then no one realizes they are being exploited. In general, reality is very continuous. Whenever someone tries to represent a phenomena as something you can ""level up"" in, chances are they are trying to fuck you, take your money, or both. <p>Until people realize this is happening, professionalism will never go away. Instead people are obsessed with ""climbing the ladder."" Thing is, climbing the ladder benefits the people at the top, not the bottom. The average person doesn't even realize this.<p>I think in order for this mentality to end, two things are needed:<p>1) People currently view social status as a function of what people with money and power think of you. People need to instead view social status a function of your ability to MSPW.<p>2) We need new forms of social signaling that take this into account. Currently people identify themselves through college credentials, brand name clothes, etc. I think social signaling DOES have an important economic role to play, however, we need new forms of social signaling based around MSPW.

Their big problem is figuring out when they're niche is going the way of the dodo, or when they aren't as good at their niche as they thought they were. different companies doing their niche best, it's an optimisation of roles.

In the intro to The Wealth of Networks, he says that the declining cost of capital has three effects:<p>1) People can do more by themselves.<p>2) People can do more in loose association with others.<p>3) People can do more in informal organizations that operate outside the market sphere.<p>The idea being that if you get 100m in investment to start a steel mill, you need to earn 100m back just to break even so you need these very rigid systems in place to maximize profit. However, when you're business only costs 10,000 to start you can harness the power of informal systems and volunteers and crowd wisdom, etc. The perfect example of this would be Wikipedia. Because it costs so little to run, it can be run by informally organized volunteers and is free to operate as a non-profit.<p>Anyway it's definitely not a beach read, but it's one of those books where if you take a year or two to fully grok the ideas within then you'll be in a stronger position to MSPW.

You can't pick your market (okay, you can't really either with your own startup).  You're stuck with the existing codebase.<p>All this is fine if you also pick up your employer's values and expectations.  But I don't know any startup founder that's like this.  Usually, if you're interested in starting a company, it's because you have some internal standards for the quality that you'd like your code to live up to and the ease with which users can use it.  So if you're working for someone else, you can easily get stuck with your own standards and your employer's tools, and the two may not match.<p>This is really, really stressful.<p>When I'm working on my startup, at least I know that any problems I'm having are <i>my</i> fault.  And I can fix them.  If I don't like the quality of the code I'm putting out, I can make the call to postpone feature X and fix bug Y instead.  If I find that a framework is becoming more of a hassle than a help, I can rip it out and replace it with my own code without my boss vetoing it.<p>There's a whole other level of stress that comes from mixing both day job and startup.  Right now, the most stressful thing in my life is wondering whether I should quit the day job to work full time on the startup.  It's stressful because there is pitiably little information and yet it's an incredibly important decision.  I won't know whether the reduced time available has caused me to miss my market opportunity until I've actually missed the market opportunity, at which point it's too late.  Similarly, I won't know whether the added time pressure has made me mortgage the startup's codebase until it becomes impossible to work with, at which point it's generally too late to fix.",,6170,,,,,

 - In May 2006, Ebay blocked Rapleaf's attempt at making seller reputations portable. Rapleaf was using Ebay's API.
 - In 1999, UPS and FedEx blocked all companies that were using their APIs to display and transact best shipping methods. All of those startups were using UPS and FedEx API. This happened again in Jan 2006, when UPS blocked www.simpletracking.com and once again in late 2006, when UPS and FedEx blocked startup www.RedRoller.com Their website is still up, but without UPS and FedEx in there, it's evident that they are dying.

6237,comment,BitGeek,1174873777,"I think YCombinator is attempting great things and has a great strategy.  However, after StartupSchool I'm mulling over my intention to build my startup without getting any funding.  Yet, what I saw yesterday was mostly based on the assumption that a startup has to go thru rounds of funding.<p>A bit of background:  I'm not young, right out of college. I've been working for startups for about 18 years with a couple periodic stints at major tech companies. In all the startups I've worked for, the two leading causes of startup death are 1) Founder friction.  2) Stupid VC tricks.<p>Founder friction is a risk that I'm sure everyone understands.  But the risk of taking money from a VC is one that I think is under appreciated.   Generally these risks manifest themselves in the form of the VC meddling in the company to the theoretical benefit of the VC, and the companies detriment.   Speaking of instances I have intimate knowledge of, in one case the investment was contingent on 1/3 of it being spent on hardware and software from two companies that the VC had ties to-- overpriced hardware when commodity PCs would have done, and very expensive software that caused us to hire consultants (from the company that sold the software of course) to try and make it work, and ultimately forced us to revert to the original plan and build it ourselves.  Significantly delaying our ability to scale up the product.  <p>In another case the VC required that we hire a new CEO, and manuvered us into hiring a friend of the Partners who was non-technical and was fond of changing company direction quarterly whether we needed it or not, to follow the latest business fad... no matter how irrelevant it was to our industry.  (EG: one quarter it was ""Push"" and we were a company that made video game technology... nothing to do with ""Push"" but we had to have a ""push story"" and issue press releases.)<p>And of course, you can find lots of other examples of similar things happening at other companies. <p>I don't want to paint with too broad of a brush.  I recognize that my experience is limited to the half dozen startups I've worked for, and the dozen or so VC partners and associates I've known over the years. <p>But I have a strong impression that these are not people who understand technology, or the technology business well enough to give good advice.   Further, they have shown a propensity to force companies to go in a direction that helps their other investments, but may be detrimental to the company. <p>And, more importantly, is investment really necessary?  <p>In this day and age, you can get servers provisioned easily-- no need to commit to hardware purchases and long term datacenter leases.  The tools are high level and easy to use and there's a lot of open source to leverage so that you can focus on the added value part of your product.   Leverage has increased dramatically.  <p>Furthermore, companies are now starting to go without investment, such as MyBlogLog which was acquired only a few months after launch without doing a VC round. <p>Thus I reach the conclusion that the course for me to take is to not seek investment at all. <p>This may not be possible for someone who is recently out of college.  (And thus the funding from YC is not the kind of investment I'm talking about here-- the presusre to use the money to get three months of solid focus on the product is really positive ""interference"" especially when backed by the rapid feedback, networking, and weekly seminars.) <p>But if you start to get some traction with your product, and you're not building something that inherently requires massive investment... probably small angel rounds are the way to go until you can be acquired or reach profitability.<p>And while being acquired may always be wise-- reaching profitability is a milestone that I think truely marks success.  Nobody can ever take that away from you once you've done it-- its victory.<p>Startupschool was great-- was good inspiration, and much of what was said checked well with my thoughts giving me a boost in confidence that I'm on the right track. <p>I love lists like ""5 dos  and 5 don'ts"" or the X things that cause startups to fail, or Pauls 16 reasons... love to check those off and go ""Yep, Yep, Yep""... and there were a couple that I need to work on. <p>Hopefully this little rant is not offending anybody... in summary, I'd say winning means making a viable business.

6242,comment,Alex3917,1174875409,"When investing in early stage companies, you put in less money and the upside is much greater. If this were the full picture then obviously early stage ventures would be a better deal. Of course, many more early stage companies go under than late stage companies. This extra risk is supposed to balance out the greater reward. But does it?<p>To borrow Kedrosky's terminology,  VC investing is really a combination of two separate skills: picking and poking. Picking is choosing which startups to invest in, and poking is helping the startup along to further its chances of success. <p>The vast majority of people investing in early stage ventures are friends, family, and fools. Because these people aren't very good at either picking or poking, their risk level is very high. This in turn drives up the cost of capital. <p>You can reduce your risk by becoming better at picking. You can also reduce your risk by becoming better at poking. And if you can become better at both, you can reduce your risk a huge amount. Because there are so few investors who are good at both, these people are barely even taken into account when determining the cost of capital. Which is why if you are good at both, it's an arbitrage opportunity for the investor.<p>For late stage ventures, there is much more money on the table which means much less amateur investment. Because you don't have as many dumb people pumping up the cost of capital, there isn't really any arbitrage opportunity. <p>Incidentally, PG has reduced his risk even further by creating news.YC so he can get to know the founders a little bit before investing. Theoretically, if a founder knows that PG has less risk because of this, the founder should be able to use this as leverage to get a better valuation. However, this doesn't work in reality because the shortage of PGs creates a market inefficiency (in favor of PG). However, I suspect that anyone who can successfully clone him will have a good arbitrage opportunity. ",,6205,,,,,

6246,comment,nostrademons,1174875997,"This is a hard question.  I considered dropping out multiple times in college, but ended up sticking it out and getting my degree.  I'm still not sure if it was the right choice, but it seems to be working out so far.  Anyways, I have no answers, but I have some observations.<p>One of my main fears in college was that I would graduate, take a soul-crushing job, and then lose all desire to start a startup.  This hasn't happened.  I still want a successful startup just as much as I did in college, or maybe even more.  You're not going to stop wanting what you've always wanted just because you have a degree, a job, money, and options.<p>OTOH, having a job and an income fucks with your perceptions a little.  I was lucky (smart?) and didn't change my spending habits; over the past year and a half that I've been working, I banked close to 90% of my take-home pay.  Even though I'm financially much more secure than I was coming out of college, it feels much more precarious - I've gotten used to having a certain amount of money coming in each month.  Quitting my day job wouldn't be an issue if I didn't have a day job.<p>Don't underestimate the experience you'll learn on the job.  I feel like I've benefited significantly from working in somebody else's startup for a year and a half before trying my own.  It also creates a sense of momentum and gets your brain in gear; you'll need all the focus you can have when starting your startup.  <p>Don't overestimate the book learning you'll get in college.  Honestly, I don't think a single thing I learned in the classroom has helped me with my startup.  <p>OTOH, a lot of college learning occurs <i>outside</i> the classroom.  My impossible quest to complete a computer science major in one semester while the department would not let me declare one turned out to be <i>exactly</i> what startup life is all about.  There will be many moments when you have to work like hell for what feels like zero payoff.  It's a good experience to really fuck up and then recover from it, because you do that a lot with startups.  If you skip the recovery part in college, how do you know you'll be able to do it with your startup?<p>Also, I met my cofounders in college.  Had I left after freshman year, I would never have known them.  Had I left later, I probably wouldn't have kept in touch.<p>Probably the biggest factor in my decision not to leave is that I didn't have a clear idea what I would do instead.  That's probably the biggest determinant: if you know <i>exactly</i> what you'll be working on instead (like Michael Dell, Bill Gates, or Mark Zuckerberg) do that instead.  If you don't, stay in school, because you'll probably end up doing nothing instead, and nothing isn't a particularly good teacher.",,6198,,,,,

I failed to make a distinction-- I am not opposed to funding, but think that VC funding is overrated.    <p>If you are seeing your business as a 1-3 year affair- if you believe that in that time period you'll either crash or get bought or go big, and you don't have any resources... then taking VC funding to cover basics like food, housing, bandwidth, maybe makes sense.  I would still say that angel funding is better.   And if you're just out of college then its kind of a no-lose situation.  You get funded, then you've won because you have a job until the funding runs out and even if you crash and burn, you'll still be well set up to do another startup. <p>But if you want to build something that lasts... you have to take into account all the costs of various types of funding.  This I may not have illuminated as well.  <p>After so many months, the VC funds turn into, effectively, a high interest rate loan with a lein against your business.  If you go to sell, you may find that they get the entire proceeds. Sometimes they even put a 2-3x liquidation preference there... so even a success results in nothing to the founders.  <p>The essense of these terms is that the clock is ticking, and you are put in a position where you have to hit a home run, or die trying.  And the VC firm will guide you in this direction, and replace you if you do not make the choices that lead that way.  They are only interested in home runs, not viable businesses. <p>This is also why acquisition is more popular now- the risk reward profile has changed, or at least people learned form the 1990s bubble.

Well, since I started, might as well get all the controversial opinions out now. :-) Remember, advice is limited experience + overgeneralization.<p>--<p>Building a startup is about leverage.  Leverage is the ability to magnify your efforts.  The bay area reduces your leverage.  Especially compared to somewhere like Seattle, or Portland, or Boulder, or Salt Lake City, etc.<p>11. Everyone is rude.  It's like living in New York or LA. The laid back california of the 70s is no more. Maybe Eureka or Weed or Barstow are good places, but the bay area is harsh.  Some relish the challenge, others just want to be left alone so they can be productive.  Being productive on your product increases leverage... <p>10. California looks so run down.  This is because it is.  The quality of life is declining rapidly.  There's nowhere to go to escape urban sprawl-- not close anyway and getting there is hours in gridlock.  Being unhappy decreases focus which decreases leverage.<p>9. The population density is so high, everyone is on prozac.  (I'm not kidding.)  Being depressed reduces leverage.<p>8. After spending 2 months there, I knew the business plans of 70+ companies in stealth mode.  Everyone knows what everyone else is doing.  Thus getting an edge on your competition is difficult, they may get your employees,  and they do know your ideas.   You have less leverage.<p>7. Every resource is in high demand, thus time spent finding real estate, finding equipment, is higher.  The local and state government levels of regulation are very high, and thus time spent dealing with the burocrats is much higher.  All these are distractions you don't need.<p>6. The availability of good startup quality employees is lower in the Bay Area.  Because startups per capita is much higher there, there are more startups competing for the same employees. <p>5. Office rent is expensive, Gas is expensive, Taxes are high, everything you could want to buy costs more.    Your burn rate is going to be much higher.<p>4. You can't find a place to live.  Your employees can't either.  Both you and your employees need more money to cover basic cost of living... your burn rate is much higher. <p>3. Being in the bay area means being on the VC treadmill.  This is the opposite of working for yourself, you are working for the VCs, and unless you triple their money in three years, you get nothing.  This forces bad decisions and much less leverage.<p>2. Long frustrating commutes reduce employee productivity and morale. They also reduce the length of the workday.<p>1. The state taxes capital gains like income!  So, even if you win, you lose.<p>
The upside... what rocks about the bay area:<p>10. Better S&M clubs.  Much. Better.<p>9. You can fantasize about one day getting a boat and sailing out under the golden gate bridge.<p>8. Skinnier (but more expensive) women who want to date geeks.<p>7. More plastic surgery.<p>6. More networking events.  <p>5. Better parties.  <p>4. More founders to commisserate with when you're forced out of your company.  <p>3. You can TP Arringtons house if he gives you a bad review, or doesn't invite you to a party, or says something particularly slimy about someone. Hell, just do it anyway.<p>2. A lot of the good conferences are there, and if they aren't, Las Vegas is closer than to other cities.<p>And the number one good thing about the bay area:<p>1. Well, at least its not Los Angeles!<p>",,6302,,6388,,,

You shouldn't be asking.  Suppose YC had an official ""don't trust nobody over 30"" policy.  Would that stop you? <p>Build it on the nights and weekends.  If you need to keep your day job, do so.  If you've never run a business before, start at least a small one.  You don't have to go whole hog in a bet the farm type situation... if your wife stays at home, a small home base business might just be the ticket (software or not...)  The reason I advise this is a business, any business, will put you thru the business school of hard knocks... and it might be easier to learn those lessons on a venture that has a lower risk of failure rate. <p>Despite the admonition against single founder businesses, there's nothing to stop you from building something on your own.  Don't wait for a co founder to show up (or build the lower risk business while you're waiting.) <p>I think finding a cofounder is like finding a wife- you can't order one thru the mail. <p>Your deterimination is a bigger factor than any of the pluses or negative you listed (well, and you can program.) <p>For what its worth, I'm 38, have been working for startups since 1991, started my first company (and online service that was also a franchise) in 1994, and sold it in 1997.

As you get closer to larger companies, people on the road tend to be more rude.  I'm thinking of the San Jose/Milpitas area.  I think most of those workers are unhappy to be treading off to their anonymous jobs :)<p>10.  Disagree.  If you live on the 101, I could see how you would feel that way, but try to drive around los gatos or saratoga and say that.  No urban sprawl.  Plus, 'quality of life' is such a nebulous term....for me, quality of life is improved just by the energy of this place and the diverse types of people it attracts.<p>9.  I don't know anyone on prozac, and I'm not sure what that has to do with population density...<p>Speaking of population density/sprawl, I met this nice lady very recently who had just relocated from Paris.  Having been lucky enough to visit there myself, I had to tell her how beautiful I thought her city was.  She said that she was happy to leave, as the bay area was a ""lot greener"" (her words) and better for children.<p>8.  You point should show anyone why the bay area is a great place.  Where else would you know 70 founders??  And getting an edge on your competition doesn't necessarily involve secrecy....<p>7.  Totally agree about having to find a home, etc.  But the regulations are pretty minor from a biz standpoint relative to the benefits of doing business here.  <p>6.  Would you rather be a big fish in a small pond?  If your startup has potential, you should not only be able to compete with other startups to hire, you will be able to pick from among the best people in the world.<p>5.  Second order problems.  Instead of looking at expenses, you should be looking at the place that allows your startup to have the most room to grow.  If your primary concern is the cost of living, move to Thailand.  Gorgeous beaches, your dollar goes incredibly far, and oh, the closest thing to a technology company there is the guy selling electronic keychains on the street...<p>4.  I've been in the valley since 2000 - it's much easier to find a place here now than it was back then.  And salaries aren't that much higher here than they are in other tech centers in the USA or even Canada.<p>3.  Disagree.  Since when is having more options a negative thing?  If you don't need VC  money, don't spend your time chasing it.  But if you do, you'll  have a much better chance getting it here. <p>Face it - if you need VC money, the treadmill exists regardless of which city your business is situated in - you'll just have an easier time getting on the treadmill if you're in the bay area.<p>2.

A couple follow ups- <p>8. No, I didn't know 70 founders, I didn't even know one.

We're all in the same pond.  I'm saying that your chances of beating Bay Area companies is better if you are not in the Bay Area.

With the dramatically higher cost of living, that means your employees are having more trouble making ends meet (or sharing houses, 2 to a bedroom.) <p>
Anyway, don't want to debate it to death, and was talking tongue in cheek to some extent.    Locality is much less important than it was in the 1980s and 1990s.  And past success has made the bay area somewhere I'm increasingly less interested in even visiting.",,6388,,6534;6423,,,

""Ever wonder precisely why big companies such as AOL are so painfully sluggish? Here's an insight. AOL recently launched an enhanced search service which, alongside search results from Google, showed capsule reviews, videos and other content from AOL itself. Straightforward enough. Splice in the different databases, slap a name on the product, pray. Not for AOL. The company engaged a top-tier naming agency, evaluated 120 different options, tested the finalists with focus groups in Denver and Chicago, checked on the meaning in 16 languages -- and the brand strategy group explained its process in a laughably belabored 20-slide presentation. After all that preparation, they forgot to remove the Powerpoint file from the website.

I don't think the 'give away the music and sell the show' is the answer though. <p>I don't think that the problem is based around people refusing to buy music. I see the current model for selling music being out of wack. ITunes is a really horrible situation for musicians. It still goes through the major label filtering before artists even see a penny. For bands not on a label it takes 35% of each song sold.

Building on previous research in gender psychology and also in user modeling, we take a data-driven approach to understanding gender preferences by mining a large corpus
of 150,000 weblog entries -- half authored by men, half by women. This paper reports two kinds of contributions. First, we employ automatic language processing, semantic analysis, and reflexive ethnography to articulate gender preferences for several dimensions of gender space will provide valuable insight to user interface designers -- time, color, size, socialness, affect, and cravings. Second, we employ
statistical gender models to build GENDERLENS -- a novel intelligent news filtering system that customizes news based on the gender of its reader. A user evaluation found that GENDERLENS successfully predicted men and women's preferences for news, with statistical significance for four out of five news genres tested.""",,6470,,,,,

Of course, learning any skill is continuous--even playing video games, but the introduction of levels is simply to give tangible, albeit artificial, goals.  It makes the gamer/user/learner feel good that they achieved another level.  There are other gaming mechanisms employed in web applications, such as collections.  Pokemon comes to mind.  This is also pretty apparent in Friendster and MySpace.  <p>I'm not sure that there's exactly anything wrong with employing game mechanisms to make something previously tedious a bit more fun for humans, but I can see how having ""the wrong metrics to measure level"" would encourage people to optimize on the wrong things (climbing ladders), instead of actually focused on getting better at the game/their careers/their job.

PG said somewhere that Viaweb spent about $2m in its entire existance. All that's changed is that the tools have improved and dedicated web hosting with decent bandwidth costs are in the hundreds instead of the thousands of dollars. It's always been possible to start a web business off a credit card or a digging into a modest nest egg - the only difference is, back then, most people saw little reason to when someone would gladly give them $5-10 million bucks (which needed to be spent) to get the site off the ground.<p>Of course, this isn't new to anyone reading this, so please excuse my audienceless rant. :)

The whole point of the ""beta"" label is to alert potential users that the product is not completely stable, but is in some usable state.  The problem is not so much that the service was not 100% reliable, but that the NYT readers expected it to be and relied critically upon it.<p>As most Linux and 'BSD users have come to learn, ""beta"" means just that: not ready for critical use.  The user gains some privileges, like being able to use ""bleeding-edge"" software or to get a valuable service for free, and in return they sacrifice the stability and reliability that comes with time-tested software; all that as they actually are an integral piece to testing that software. Without such a beta stage, the whole rapid development movement would fail as projects get mired in extensive internal testing stages.<p>Your GMail comment especially strikes me, as I hadn't considered that before.  Perhaps they grew much faster than anticipated and are still working on stability issues, and the ""losing my emails"" scenario may not be far off the mark.

This makes your customers think that you are actively developing your product and that there is momentum behind your product.""<p>This statement really irks me, not just as a programmer, but as a consumer.  I initially thought the article might be a little joke, but since the other tips were more reasonable, I have to assume that it is serious.  I can understand holding back features in your initial release, but there are much better reasons than those that were cited.  To purposely trick your potential users seems to me to be a bad business model, and smells of the corporate mindset of money and growth over all else. I think it is important to remember that the whole point of developing a product is to fulfill a need (or want) of the customer, and I think that as the average consumer gets more intelligent, these types of tactics will be more transparent and will do more harm than good to the startup.<p>As for better reasons for holding back features:<p>1. In any interesting piece of software, I would imagine that there are potentially hundreds of features which could be added.  The difficult problem is deciding when to be (temporarily) content with what you have and release.  Thus, some desired features must be left out in order to avoid the perfectionist mindset, where nothing ever gets released.<p>2. A mostly-implemented feature may work correctly most of the time, but fail mysteriously at other times. Even with a beta release, it's probably best to avoid these types of features which only serve to make your product less reliable.<p>3. A feature may be fully-implemented, but there may be no clear way to integrate it into the UI.  In this case, it would probably be best to hold off and drop hints of the feature to beta testers, who could give their feedback on how best to integrate it.  After all, the feature is meant for the users to actually use, isn't it?<p>4. A feature may add computational complexity to the software which may be overly taxing on the initial hardware that a startup company is using. Improve the hardware before adding the feature, or better yet, improve the code which implements the feature.<p>

The title, however, could use a little work.  I think it's important for us to avoid the mindset of, ""This company is highly profitable, so I want to figure how to beat them and steal their revenue,"" and instead shift to, ""This company is doing a great job, but I can provide a valuable service by improving upon such and such feature.""  In a market where there are hundreds of options and new ones appearing every day, the most important thing is to provide a new, valuable service.

The essay cleared up things things that the video obscured (couldn't see the visuals), like the ""not-so-smart"" / ""enterprise software"" connection (I was thinking he just meant the competition was dumb so you'd have the one-eyed man / land of the blind advantage).  <p>The big surprise is that YC hasn't seen an order of magnitude increase in applicants from their first round.  You'd think this impossible: Paul announced the first YC program only about a week before its deadline and they got something like 250 applications.  Now they are all over the tech news and they still haven't cracked 1000?  Maybe PG's new speaking approach (memorize, practice, use visuals) is an effort to get more people fired up?  <p>Paul, regarding this new speaking style: you <i>could</i> make yourself into a Steve Jobs dynamo of a speaker, but I think you shouldn't.  Your usual wordsmith style is probably better for attracting nerds.      <p>Question: Paul, it sounds like you've mostly swung in the direction of encouraging people to look at their own lives for problems to solve.  Whereas in ""Why Smart People Have Bad Ideas"" you were saying the opposite, like in the two paragraphs starting with ""Reading the Wall Street Journal for a week should give anyone ideas... ""  Trevor says something similar in the footnotes.  But it looks like YC has been placing all its bets on the first sort of ideas.  There's a good reason: all the huge software successes come from the ""build it for you and your friends"" model because those are the problems you fully understand.  But it's more common to find software companies making solid profits on products they built for others' problems.  Am I overlooking YC companies building products designed for other people?  Is the problem that there just aren't enough potential founders like the Octopart guys: people deeply involved in some non-computing world who also happen to be good programmers?  If so, maybe the richest source of ideas and cofounders would be cruising web forums for the near-programmers (people who build things like MS Access half-solutions to their companies' problems) to listen to what they would like to build if only they knew how. Maybe YC should be recruiting there, too.  Thoughts?

6711,comment,BrandonM,1175034183,"At first I was thinking, <i>Wikipedia is great as is.  Besides, why compete with a free product?</i>  Once I actually visited the site and read the philosophy, however, I have to concede that it's at least worth a shot.  This idea is clearly the result of someone saying, ""What is wrong with Wikipedia, and how can we fix it?""  The main problems, as I see it, are:<p>1. Defacing of high-profile articles.
- This is potentially solved by requiring the use of real names, and also by the oversight.<p>2. Perceived inaccuracy.
- While Wikipedia does at times have inaccuracies, the reality is that the media and others who do not often use it have an exaggerated view of the extent of the inaccuracy. By adding expert oversight, this should quell some of the cries regarding lack of reliability.<p>The only potential problems I see is that Wikipedia already has a lot of inertia, which includes a much better name.  Citizendium is just too hard to say to become a buzzword.  It will also see much slower growth, and I posit that it will never be able to reach the size of Wikipedia, because its growth function is inherently less steep.<p>That said, one could contend that the majority of quality articles on Wikipedia are submitted by a very small minority of the users.  If even some of these authors move to Citizendium due to frustration with the constant maintenance of their articles or the incorrect perception of inaccuracy, then Citizendium truly has a chance.

I can see how the companies he's funded have shown that working first is probably not necessary. I also understand his argument that trying and failing can teach you more than working for a company would anyway. But I think it really depends on the company. Not all larger tech companies suck. And I'd still argue that working in the corporate environment (even for just a short while) teaches you a lot of valuable lessons. <p>I guess my view is weigh the options. Some larger companies (mainly the people you work with there) can teach you new and diversive things you simply cant learn on your own. Looking back 10 months to when I just graduated, I definitely feel I've learned a lot about accountability and being responsible from the corporate work environment. It also modivates the hell out of you to break free of the mandatory work hours and start something on your own..",,6668,,,,,

6791,comment,Alex3917,1175052441,"""It's exciting to think we may be on the cusp of another shift like the one from farming to manufacturing.""<p>The biggest reason why startups are so much more feasible now than ever before is because of the plummeting costs of production. Whereas twenty years ago it would have taken millions of dollars to do a startup, today a college kid with a powerbook can do one in his dorm room. Every year the tools of production get exponentially more powerful and less expensive.<p>To play devil's advocate, these same factors that are currently driving startups may ultimately be their demise as well. Almost every tool can be used for both good and evil. A hammer can be used to drive a nail, or also to harm someone. Governments have taken it on themselves to try to allow the good uses of any given technology while regulating the evil purposes. The problem is that every time they try to regulate away an evil, there is inevitably a little spill over that prevents us from using the technology for good. Every time a powerful new technology is invented, we end up losing little bits of our rights and civil liberties. <p>As technologies exponentiate in both their power and interconnectedness, it seems as if society (at least ours) will go down the road of increasingly restricting freedoms in order to prevent terrorism and other evils.<p>It isn't hard to imagine that as the costs of production approach zero, so will the freedoms that enable us to start startups. In many countries, such as Japan and Germany, it is so hard to do anything other than the status quo that it is effectively illegal. In Germany the government subsidizes the wages of students finishing school, which makes it effectively impossible to get a job without graduating. And in Japan it's even worse.<p>If the past is any indicator, the same forces driving the boom in startups are ultimately going to be drivers in forcing people into more restrictive social structures. <p>N.B. I don't necessarily believe this, but I think it is a serious argument that has never really been rebutted. Perhaps because the guy who proposed the idea was driven insane by it is currently doing life in prison for killing a bunch of people (Kaczynksi). ",,6668,,6941,,,

I'm two weeks into my startup, which I'm basing on a Paul Graham/Joel Spolsky hybrid model. I'm building up capital by taking on some small- to medium-sized projects while prototyping my real idea behind the scenes with a few collaborators.<p>While my work struggles to find my replacement, I have no problems finding people that A) want to work for me on contract projects, and B) want me to work on their projects (right now there is a queue). I actually work longer now than I did in the office. But I'm not tired. In fact, I have more energy. Additionally, if you normalize my work hours, I am even more productive working on my own. I just generally feel better about myself and am only experiencing ""good"" stress these days. I encourage anyone who finds themselves agreeing with Paul Graham in his essays more often than not to make the leap.<p>I fundamentally agree with Paul Graham about the change we are seeing. In fact, my little prototype bets the farm on the premise that this change is indeed happening.<p>I'm sufficiently capitalized having had a couple of years out of school to make some money that Y Combinator's funding is, quite frankly, an unattractive proposition. Plus, I'm in Toronto and I love the city. I live/work downtown right near the university. I would not want to move. All this said, is there any chance that you will do a talk up here in Canada?

6875,comment,nurall,1175074876,"Another way of looking at this is to realize that beta testers are hard to come by, and one could leverage from the already existing pool of beta testers (53,651). Most startups want to improve their pre-money valuation before going to the VC, the most important ingredient for achieving that is a stable system that is a result of successive relevant iterations of the features. This could as well be part of any Web 2.0 company's road map for the first few months upon going live. It is needless to say that for a VC to be convinced, it is important to have the right kind of users. If there is even a little bit of overlap between the 53,651 web savvy users and the ideal end-user, it is safe to assume that viral marketing will take care of itself. An example that glares in the face is Google. Their systems are the way they are, thanks to their #1 beta testers, their employees. And one could argue that there are other beta testers at various levels, namely the actual end users. This statistic seems to do more good than harm, if regarded positively. The eventual end users of the system could just be an extension of the 53,651 initial users. Go Techcrunch!!!",,4101,,,,,

12.  Need for Structure:
While some people do seem to have a built-in need for structure, sometimes that structure can be ""There Is No Structure.""  I'd say:<p>The problems appear when the expected structure is differs from what actually exists.  <p>Employees will stagnate in what feels like a structured environment if they are given no instruction.  However, if it's clear from the start that no structure will be provided, they won't waste time waiting.  On the other side, managers may get upset if employees don't follow policy with military precision, despite the fact that military structure hasn't been provided and the relevant policy is 30 pages deep in a handbook no one has read in 2 years.  The manager can either figure out how to include military drilling, or accept that degree of structure is unworkable.<p>My impression of Y Combinator is that it's fairly clear early on how much structure is provided (or not provided).

6941,comment,BrandonM,1175100751,"It's a little discouraging, after considering PG's idea that we may be on the cusp of another production revolution, to consider some of the ideas that you put forward here.  I do think, however, that you are right in saying that it is very hard to rebut the idea that you present.<p>I don't really think, though, that what you present are the precise beliefs of Kaczynski.  In your comment, you seem to have the idea that decreasing costs of production (which is largely due to improvements in technology) is a good thing, while the decrease in freedom is the thing that is bad.  It seems to me that anarcho-primitivists actually believe that technology itself is the bad thing, because it departs from the pure, hierarchy-less society of hunter-gatherers.<p>It is truly an interesting endeavor to consider where the boundary exists between what is good about where we are headed and what is bad.  I think that all of us accept the idea that those who have greater drive and motivation to succeed should be rewarded for their efforts, and it's also hard to deny PG's contention that people now are living more luxurious lifestyles than kings of yesterday (heated houses year 'round).  We may also argue that if people are content with their station in life (i.e. doing nothing to change it), then what is the problem?<p>On the other hand, I think that nearly all of us would agree that a situation like that in the Matrix would be a bad thing; even though the people believe they are living well, it is all a facade.  Additionally, we are perfectly okay with improving the lives of friends and family members who have been less driven than we, presumably because we love them.<p>I guess if you consider the implications of that train of thought, if we loved humanity, we would be perfectly fine with sharing everything equally, regardless of the amount of work the individual does, and we thereby arrive back where we started, with hunter-gatherer cultures that have gift societies.  We can even see evidence of this model working in the open source movement today.<p>I'm not really trying to make any points here, I'm just pointing out some interesting questions that your post (and my readings on Kaczynski) brought up in my mind which made me question what I had previously considered to be unquestionable truths.  Perhaps it's not necessary for the entrepreneur's reward to be directly proportional to the amount of wealth the he or she has created, especially considering that with the current state of social stratification, opportunity is certainly not equal.",,6791,,6953,,,

It is our duty, because 99% of American programmers are either too content with their life or only dedicate 2 hours a day to creating something (plus have no understanding of what exactly they are trying to accomplish so they give up early), and the other programmers in other countries have no hope of ever starting a business, no matter how good their grades are, or how smart and ambitious they are.<p>It is our duty to create startups that solve some problem and help people, and give people jobs.<p>Also, remember that you may think you're getting 100% of the experience working for a startup or running a part-time business, but unless you make it your only source of income, you are not really giving it 100%.

7100,comment,vlad,1175122864,"I think the main part of the ""Jobs-Wozniak"" relationship that people forget to mention is that Jobs approached Wozniak and thought that's what they should market.<p>In other words, you're not a Wozniak just because you're heavily into technology.  Wozniak created a bunch of stuff because he wanted something very useful for himself and he was going to create it on a tight budget.  That is actually what great leaders do (at least according to some leadership books and my own experience)--they don't create something and then force it onto other people.  Nor do they tell people what to do.  They simply start doing it themselves and then other people notice and want to take part.  (In other words, if you want people to do what you're saying, start doing it yourself and people will copy it or want to be around you when you prove it works.  Don't just start telling people what to do.)<p>So, Wozniak is more than a technical guy.  He was exhibiting silent leadership about hardware.  And Jobs was exhibiting leadership in how software should be later on.<p>If you think you want a Jobs, are you a Wozniak to even have such a comparison?  In other words, are you creating a software or hardware product for yourself that makes things so much easier and better that other people notice it and approach you and tell you, we can sell this?  Remember, Wozniak didn't ask anybody. That's the relationship that happened.  Not, ""Oh, you created a bunch of code, let's try to somehow convert it into a business.""  The idea made sense in the first place.<p>So, if you're 100% technical, the best thing to do is to show what you do to everybody.  Don't force it on to them, and don't worry about anybody copying you since if you're clearly enjoying what you're doing and they think it's a worthwhile thing to do, everybody will want to join you.  Remember, if you're a Wozniak, it means you can basically display your ideas everywhere, even to roomfuls of technical people like Woz did, and know that everything will be OK.",,7094,,,,,

7171,comment,mauricecheeks,1175137521,"IMHO - I don't think there is a very good way to ""tell"" someone you are a visionary. <p>Nor do I think there is any good way to know of yourself that you are a visionary to the tune of Steve Jobs. People say that the ideas that Jobs has that seem to ""change the world"" come to him as clear solutions to obvious problems. So you likely think your ideas seem fairly simple and makes perfect sense, only assuming that others could come up with them just as well. <p>I think the mentality of ""something is obviously broken and if no-one else can see this seemingly obvious solution, then I'll just do it myself"" is common among great inventors. <p>Steve and Woz shared this inventor's mentality, however Woz was content building stuff for fun to show friends. Jobs (being a visionary) saw the business potential and wanted to lead the technology into changing the future. <p>So to answer your question: All that you can show PG (especially in these applications) is that you have a cool idea, and that as a visionary you have plans for a real business that will make sense (aka have value) to people.<p>If you have an idea that will change the future, or just improve people's general quality of life... it is your responsibility (as Jobs) to mold that idea into your vision for a business that will make you and your co-founder(s) some money.<p>Woz created the Apple computer, but SJ convinced Woz and investors that they had a greater market than DIYers, and that ""personal computers"" was the way of the future. <p>Hopefully your vision works out as well as the Personal Computer, and then whether your start is with PG or not - people will be able to see you for the visionary that you are.

7210,comment,blats,1175149673,"""Even the founders who fail don't seem to have such a bad time.""<p>I was a founder in a startup that died late last year. It was the hardest I have ever worked, and one of the most challenging things I have ever done. It was frustrating in so many ways and there was amazing amounts of strife involved. In the end the project ran out of money and the products of my labor and imagination are now gathering dust in storage. After all that, without any monetary reward, I would do it all again in a second. The challenge of following my senses through completely unknown territory and the reward of seeing my idea come to life was more then enough to make the whole thing worth it. It was the challenge that drove me. In the end it was the challenge itself that rewarded me even though the company didn't fly.<p>
""A lot of people think they're too young to start a startup. Many are right. The median age worldwide is about 27...""<p>I do agree completely with the idea that adulthood is a state of mind and not an age. I remember my dad asking me ""What do you want?"" when i was somewhere between 18 and 21. My reply at that time was ""I just want to be comfortable."" I remember it quite distinctly. He then told me ""I expect that will change some day, given your creed."" He was right,  and I realized it while in the midst of working my tail off on a project. All I wanted to do was work on my ideas, see them come to life. The discomfort didn't slow me down at all, it was the challenge that I wanted.<p>
""You need a lot of determination to succeed as a startup founder. It's probably the single best predictor of success.""<p>A founder without determination is not going to succeed, but their drive can't cause them to loose perspective. One can dig with a singular purpose and make a big hole, but if it is in the wrong place it does the project no good.<p>
""You don't need to know anything about business to start a startup.""<p>True, but eventually the business skills will be required if the project is to continue. My experiences have taught me that while a viable product is most of the battle, a lack of resources on the business end of a project can stop it in it's tracks. Weather it is the founders themselfs that learn the skills, or outside resources are brought in to help - the skills must be obtained. The lesson I learned is pick the right people to depend on, or depend on yourself. Implementing your ideas is great all in itself, but it is much better if there is someone interesting there to see it when you finish.<p>""If you don't have a co founder, what should you do? Get one.""<p>Be careful! Going into business with someone in the startup environment is a commitment. You will spend allot of time with them and you will have to depend on them constantly. It is almost like a marriage, choose wisely. Good friends do not always make good business partners.<p>
""In a sense, it's not a problem if you don't have a good idea...""<p>I believe that a person's ability to learn, gain skills, and adapt is the most important thing period. You find someone with a carrot, you've just got a carrot. Even if you need a carrot, their value is limited once they give it to you. Find a gardener and you can grow anything you need. Reminds me of some proverb about choosing a fishing pole or a fish.<p>
""This one is real. I wouldn't advise anyone with a family to start a startup.""<p>I agree with this 100%. I did it, and I would not advise it for someone with a choice. My family is amazing and supportive and more then anything else they KNOW me. I have founder pumping through my veins. The startup world is home to me, there is no question that I will be a serial entrepreneur. Good ideas give me goosebumps, unsolved problems give me insomnia. My family supports who I am, so I am able to do what makes me happy. Successfully pouring your soul into a project and being a member of a family at the same time is a learned skill. Play it safe unless you know what you are getting into, or just can't change who you are.<p>
""Start another company? Are you crazy?""<p>See above.<p>
""Be aware, though, that if you get a regular job, you'll probably end up working there for as long as a startup would take, and you'll find you have much less spare time than you might expect.""<p>Working a regular job instead of chasing dreams is still a commitment. Yes, you can work a regular job without thinking about it all the time. You can go to work 8 hours a day 5 days a week and not have it take over the rest of your personal time. Having said that, is it really worth it? Why do something all day that you don't care about? Sounds flawed to me.<p>
""Each person should just do what they need to without anyone telling them.""<p>This throws back to the ""pick carefully"" comment. Your choice in business partners is paramount. There are many many people who will just stand there on the field with the ball looking confused. Within the constraints of a startup you may not have time to figure it out after the fact. Make sure you know they can work, and that they can work with you.<p>
""If you go to work for Microsoft, you can predict fairly accurately what the next few years will be likeÃÂall too accurately, in fact. If you start a startup, anything might happen.""<p>This is part of what attracts me to the role of a founder. Clicking send on an important proposal and not knowing what will happen is like jumping off a bridge for me (with cord of course). I love not knowing, I love the process of finding out. I love the risks you have to take and the rewards you can reap. Anything can happen, and that resonates with me.<p>
""A significant number of would-be startup founders are probably dissuaded from doing it by their parents.""<p>This is a problem I never had. My dad tells a story about having a booth across the aisle from Oracle WAY back when they were both small. He was lead developer on a similar DB app called RDM which was a far more mature and fully featured product at the time. His business leaders thought conservatively, Oracle shot for the stars. The rest is history. My father will never discourage me from chasing my ideas, and my mom just loves to see me glow. He was there, at the time and the place; he chose the steady paycheck.<p>
""Imagine being sad on Sunday afternoons because the weekend was almost over, and tomorrow you'd have to get up and go to work. How did they stand it?""<p>What, as apposed to kicking back - stretching out - and wondering what day it is on Sunday afternoon? Never.. operating by the seat of your pants and living your ideas is the only way to go. Its the best feeling in the world, and the bad times only make the good ones better.<p>[edit] Getting my proverbs straight.",,6668,,,,,

Great article, I found it extremely helpful and encouraging.  I did have one question though around point # 9. Family to support.  When you started Viaweb, did you have a family?  If not, what about when you founded Y Combinator?  The reason I ask is that I feel that having a family is a huge motivator for success, not a detractor.  Now it is extremely risky especially if you are the sole provider for the family, but the reward is extremely high.  If you have the confidence, determination and the right support (money, good business partners, etc.) your chances of success are increased.  That would be like saying that it is not wise to be an extreme sports athlete or even a race car driver if you have a family because it is too risky.  Calculated risks have great potential. <p>Will<p>",,6668,,8517,,,

Then they get comfortable with being able to provide for themselves well (and frequently a girlfriend or wife).<p>Even without kids there's a lot of commitment there. A 1 year lease on a nice apartment, a girlfriend/wife ""accustomed"" to living comfortably, car loan/insurance, etc.<p>Years of people doing this means that the highest potential founders have day jobs right now. For them paths to a startup are 1) Make a lifestyle change and go back to having little money. 2) Get sizable funding 3) Manage to pull off something in their spare time.<p>I think #2 and #3 are rarely successful, making #1 the most likely path to startup success for someone in this position.<p>Give up money, car, (nice) housing, girlfriend/wife(?), etc. to slave away with no life on a startup that will probably fail. Certainly seems like a good filter for determination, the most important attribute, the chances of success for these people must be higher.<p>I suppose YC figures that the potential for these people is not significantly high enough to justify the smaller number they could fund.

7283,comment,BrandonM,1175180029,"The problem with motivation for an undergrad is when you realize that everything doesn't need to be the way it is now.  Let me clarify.  Most of us have been raised our whole lives with the mantra, ""You have to go to college to succeed.""  I know that my parents didn't go to college, and they were always saying, ""You don't want to end up where I am, working in a factory,"" etc.<p>The problem with that model, however, is that a standard undergraduate education is beginning to become old-fashioned and irrelevant.  How many stories do you hear about students going to four years of school only to graduate and be unable to find employment?  While the problem is not nearly as bad in engineering as in other fields, it's still the case that more and more people are going to college, and as a result, a degree doesn't look nearly as great as it did 20 or 30 years ago.<p>I personally have started to become disenfranchised with the college model in the US.  As an undergrad, I have visited some undergraduate committee meetings and talked personally with a few professors, and the bureaucracy of the whole thing is somewhat disgusting.  Even if a professor wants to make a change to the curriculum (for the better), he or she must endure countless meetings and votes, even for something that is clearly a good idea.  It may take a year or more just to make a minor structural change in a few core courses.<p>Moreover, department heads are not much worried about the success (or lack thereof) of undergrads.  For whatever reason, national groups that rank colleges look mainly at entrance criteria, so as long as the college can successfully lock out those students with low ACT scores (which are largely irrelevant), they look good on paper.  Meanwhile, they hire new professors based <i>only</i> on their research and some interviews, without much regard for teaching backgrounds.<p>In the end, once you go off and create your own startup and work on your own projects, you start to see that college is largely not helpful to an undergrad.  The stuff that is stretched out over four years could probably be learned quite easily by most in two or less, if it was all restructured a bit.  College, in effect, is just another corporation, one that is in the business of paying professors and researching new ideas.  It just happens that most professors do not produce enough ideas quickly enough to justify their income, so undergraduate students make up for that by paying tuition.<p>Once you realize that you can be successful without completing (or even starting) your undergrad, the dedication, motivation, and finances necessary to complete college just don't look like such a good trade anymore.  Most courses follow a textbook, anyways, so just buy the textbook, study it yourself, talk to people online, and you will probably do just as well.  The only downside is that you'll be missing that shiny piece of paper.",,7182,,7503;7313,,,

Read Paul's comments about the need for focus and determination.

Keep that in mind.

Why lose a mortgage (and your wife!) over a dream? If you're married and want to have a family, get a stable job, get a mortgage and take care of your family's future. Not having any money (or very little) for few years can be extremely stressful on a marriage... especially if you're not financially stable. If you're financially stable and have millions in the bank, well, then this does not apply to you and you can do whatever pleases you.<p>2) You won't have as much time since your wife will demand that you spend a lot of time with her. If you're in a startup, your startup will be your wife and your kid and your family for at least a year. You'll be competing against other teams which don't have time limitations and against people who are working 12-14 hr days. You simply won't be able to compete with them. If you start spending less time in a startup than your cofounders, there will be some serious tensions!<p>3) Do you have young kids? Spend your time with kids, not in a startup.

7325,comment,rfrey,1175186758,"Hi, Omarish.  The tragedy of the commons (economists call these situations ""negative externalities"") doesn't apply to Web 2.0 in my opinion.  <p>The tragedy of the commons stems from a basic cost/benefit calculation: in business, if something costs you more than you make, you either stop selling it or you go out of business.  The basic problem of a negative externality is that while the profit accrues to an individual, the cost hidden from that individual and is borne by the community.  So a non-viable activity continues to be performed, until the community goes bankrupt. (I.e., the field is depleted and cannot sustain sheep).  Some argue that pollution falls into this category.  (Note that this is not necessarily an argument for private ownership of everything: the principle problem is costs exceeding benefits, and those costs being hidden from producers so that their incentives are misaligned.  Privatization is one way, but probably not the only way, to align incentives.)<p>But in Web 2.0, there are no hidden costs that are depleting the overall store.  Companies pay for their bandwidth, pay for their storage, etc.  No costs are shifted to the community as near as I can tell.  <p>A better model for what you're talking about might be network effects -  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effects"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effects</a>

I'm an environmentalist and refugee infrastructure consultant by trade, although I did spend about 10 years doing software including a number of start ups. My projects include minor roles in <a href=""http://oilendgame.org/"">http://oilendgame.org/</a> <a href=""http://smallisprofitable.org"">http://smallisprofitable.org</a> and technical lead on <a href=""http://database.biomimicry.org/"">http://database.biomimicry.org/</a><p>My main project is an award winning, public domain / free/libre refugee shelter system called the hexayurt.<p>So, I've got a technology that I'm looking to get turned into a product. For ethical reasons there will be no patents or IP protection - you could write a closed implementation, patent additional side features etc - but the basic ideas are already disclosed. The cat is out of the bag, because this is refugee stuff which <i>just happens</i> to have some other applications, and so I disclosed it to make sure it would not be patentable from my work. There may be other patent issues, although none have arisen so far - we have yet to hit prior art.<p>Technologies: mobile phone programming, 2D bar codes, very large databases, and some basic understanding of cryptosystems. Like, how to call the libraries, not how to roll your own broken encryption.<p>Now, here's the kicker: if I'm not <i>entirely</i> mistaken, I have a customer lined up. A Large Customer. If that turns out not to be true, there's no point starting this thing.<p>If, however, it is, the gig would start with one large contract, and then if you can then make this into a company, you go right ahead. I'm fully engaged pushing the Hexayurt Shelter System (a free/libre refugee infrastructure system) and don't have time to do a start up. I can advise, and make the introductions. From there in it would be up to you to make it a success, working with that client. My compensation is likely to be largely as a subcontractor to that client, working on the design end.<p>Interested? hexayurt@gmail.com",,7373,,7384,,,

The core challenge is to print a lot of data on an A4 / US Letter sized piece of paper, and then get that data back off the paper and into an application running on a cell phone.<p>Ideally, this would work on any old phone. Realistically, this would be vertically integrated - you'd get to pick the phone, and the printing format for the page containing the data. From the specs and the initial discussions I've had with companies in the field, the speed of light for 2D bar codes is about 3mb per page (Data Matrix) and the choke point is mobile phone camera quality, particularly focal length issues (can't focus properly on the close page.)<p>Approaches: using better phones, deconvolution algorithms, c'mon guys, you know how to fix this.<p>After that, there's some extremely simple large scale database stuff which looks, to my eye at least, to be a natural fit for REST. <p>Basically:<p>Yank data off the page<p>think about it<p>do stuff over GPRS/3G or - ugh - SMS (yeah... SMS out, SMS back... terse data formats.)<p>Done.<p>Nothing about this is difficult. The crypto fits in just to ensure data integrity - make sure that the bar codes haven't been damaged, or that the data on the bar codes isn't stale.<p>Ok? Enough here to be going on with? Do we need to belabor the point further? For the right team, <i></i>assuming<i></i> the deal comes through, this would be an easy gig.<p>If it doesn't, there's no gig, no client, no business, even if I disclosed the rest of the pieces here. So it's a potential and there's not much you can do to make it happen or not. But if it does come through, first plausible team might make a pretty good living for a few months and possibly be left with a viable company at the end of it. Can't promise more than that. In terms of IP, there would be full disclosure, no NDAs, no patents on my work as I described. There could be competition, although probably not, and for other reasons I'm not simply posting the whole damn design on the internet (more on that angle later.)<p>Ok, done.

7471,comment,rfrey,1175220502,"In the beginning, there was HTML, and lo, there was much rejoicing among the scientists.  Content was king.  HTML was to provide guidelines for presentation, without dictating exact formatting.  Lynx and Mosaic users existed in harmony.<p>Then came the .com rush, and with them, their horde of designers.  Designers used tables to wring miracles from HTML, all above the protests of the purists -- ""HTML is not a page description language!"", ""What about the Lynx users??"" etc.<p>But what the purists missed was that the landscape had changed.  HTML was no longer just about content: de facto, it had become about the presentation as well.  Eventually CSS caught up and specs mirrored reality.<p>Ironically, it's the designers, like the author, who are now missing the context change.  It's their turn to be the dinosaurs.  Web 2.0 is not just about more presentation options; spice and sugar on a page-oriented website.  AJAX is about building applications that use the browser as the environment.  Protesting that cell phone users won't be able to use the app is missing the point.  Do people complain that Writely doesn't work on a cellphone? <p>(Well, maybe they do.  Stuff 'em! :)

I disagree with a strict cost-benefit approach, however.  As an analogy, Microsoft has been benefiting from this phenomenon for years due to hardware companies who only write Windows drivers, while NVidia is a good example of a hardware company which provides open source drivers and receives loyalty and sales opportunities because of it.  Additionally, supporting cell phone users and the visually impaired is certainly a good idea, even if only a small percentage of visitors fall into these categories.<p>Of course, as numerous others mentioned, it's important to be aware of your target audience, but don't be surprised if your actual audience does not necessarily match the one you have in mind.",,7449,,,,,

I think in nearly any usage pattern, this would be the data point that you would be most concerned with.  You want users browsing your pages to get their pages and small images very quickly, and if they have to wait a couple seconds for the larger images to finish, or for minutes for large file downloads, that seems to be the kind of behavior a user would expect.<p>What this scheduling algorithm avoids is the case where several people are downloading large files and other more casual users are having a worse browsing experience because of that.",,7521,,,,,

I used to work for a big enterprise software company, and it took me a while to get used to the fact that we're selling crappy software for millions of $ a piece.
I think the problem is that large enterprises trust other large organizations to solve their problems. You can't really get ahead in a large enterprise and become a manager with a budget to spend on software solutions unless you have that kind of organizational mindset. You fear change and fear failure, and so you'd rather spend tons of cash on a crappy solution from someone ""trustworthy"" - so they can't blame you if the software you bought sucks, than on a small startup's product that no one else in your industry is using.

It was only later on when I started to learn more about the people behind these theories, and the challenges that motivated them, that it became more interesting. The founders of all this knowledge were trying to get one thing or the other done, and this is what motivated them to construct these mind bending abstractions. <p>I think it is a lot more effective to give students challenges rather than knowledge. When they get stuck (and they will get stuck eventually), then give them the knowledge they need to overcome their obstacles. Of course, you never know, without having some pre-determined way of solving something, the students might end up discovering a smarter ways of solving the same problems!

I went to a Montessori school from kindergarten through third grade, and I can't stress enough how badly that specific Montessori school failed.  Teachers were distant, more like babysitters than having any kind of structure.  Any project we wanted to work on was fine, but most of us didn't do anything (the equivalent of pretending to work at work).  We'd have to keep track of what we did in journals and get them signed by a teacher, so most of us made up stuff and forged the teacher's signature.  I don't remember learning any mathematics at all back then.  In fact, I'm positive that it wasn't until fourth grade that I got into basic math.  I don't know if that's normal, but my father had been teaching me math outside of school from a very early age, so I was still strong in it.  It's a very strange school system.<p>My final observation is that my Montessori school was so <i>small</i>!  I was a shy kid, and going to a small school from K-3rd grade, then another small school from 4th-8th grade, did not help me to become a social person one bit.  If you do something against the group, everyone will hate you, resulting in more shyness.  Even at third grade.<p>You probably should evaluate your child.  Is s/he shy?  If so, it may be a benefit to send them to a larger school.  I'm not saying that it will cure them of shyness, but it may help.<p>I'll totally respect any decision you make though :)",,7636,,7652,,,

The internet is a wonderful thing, however programs like Blackboard fail to take into account group interaction.

Also, I agree that your method of learning is superior, however the entity that creates this must accept that public schools teach in a certain way and change very slowly.<p>Another problem is dealing with online predators.  Any kind of social software created for schools is going to create huge waves of uproar unless people are sure that predators, real or imagined, can't communicate with students.

What you have to do is put together something that convinces these people that not investing in you now is leaving money on the table. Don't worry about failure to get financing at this stage; there's always more people out there looking for the next hot startup to invest in. All you have to do is convince first yourself and then these other people that you can do this.<p>I would caution you against using college loans to fund your startup. For one thing, it's probably foolish to borrow money for this when there are people who will invest if you spend the time to get them interested. But for another thing, it may be a violation of federal law, with serious consequences if you get caught. A CPA or lawyer may be able to advise you about your options here.",,7049,,,,,

7956,comment,binarybana,1175409567,"This past week I was able to talk a partner of an oil and gas VC that specializes in small scale (less than 10M) projects. One of the things I asked her was if the 'small-fry' oil and gas industry was being smothered by the giants of Exxon, BP, and Shell much as some people claim is being done by Microsoft, Google, and Yahoo. She replied that the big three are only able to pursue and develop the projects which show a high margin due to their high operating costs thereby allowing small ventures to flourish in projects that aren't 'profitable enough'.<p>Certainly this argument has also been made for the internet market too, but the oil and gas market is heavily capital dependent with large 'retooling' costs whereas the internet industry is driven largely by a smart labor force (ie: a more agile industry). So is it a possibility that small time internet ventures are more vulnerable to attack than the equivalent oil and gas company (and other industries for that matter)?",,7955,,7957,,,

We were a dozen or so high schoolers, ages ranging from 15 through 19, building a ""teen content"" site with indirect venture funding (we were a wholly-owned subsidiary of a venture-funded startup).  This was the summer of 2000, at the height of the dot-com boom.  The NASDAQ had just peaked, but nobody knew it yet.<p>We got picked up first by the local community newspapers, then the Boston Herald, then the local TV news.  Then we ran out of funding, but we continued getting press inquiries for several months after we were technically out of business.  <p>We had a $20k PR budget (which we inflated to $50k whenever we talked to people), but we never spent any of it.

Maybe I'm just thinking too far ahead, but the same goes for dates that I go on. Dumb clueless girls actually turn me off (even if pretty). My friends think I am kidding when I say I am attracted to women a little older than me because they assume I am a gold-digger. But I'm not, I just like their maturity over girls my age.<p>Anyway, for the longest time, I couldn't really describe, I didn't have any solid metrics on how to explain to a friend, why I think a girl is mature/inmature. It's not about the age. <p>I think your point about pulling the ""I'm just a kid"" card totally makes sense. Kids tend to wait for something to happen (reactive) -- wait for their mom/dad/boss to tell them to do something, they need to be prodded, at which they will say ""do I really need to brush my teeth now?"" and groan. Adults are they ones who anticipate the next move, planning the strategy of where to go next, looking out for potential pitfalls and coming up with ideas of mitigating (proactive).<p>I guess I just am attracted to driven people, and dislike pessimists. I've seen plenty of people in college and in corporate who pessimists/downers like that, because they can't come up with new ideas/strategies. So by shooting at ideas of their peers, and bringing their peers down to their level -- they get to maintain the status-quo.

8111,comment,whacked_new,1175483202,"Here are some thoughts I have regarding popularity meters on news sites and such. Maybe some people would find it interesting or possibly useful. I would also love to hear other opinions, so do share.<p>I am sure many readers here have seen the new SlashRating box, which sports digg-esque (generally speaking) number ratings for each article. Maybe you noticed that the Gmail Paper article (<a href=""http://slashdot.org/articles/07/04/01/0631243.shtml)"">http://slashdot.org/articles/07/04/01/0631243.shtml)</a> and the X-Files article right after it (<a href=""http://slashdot.org/articles/07/04/01/1231211.shtml)"">http://slashdot.org/articles/07/04/01/1231211.shtml)</a> have substantially different SlashRatings (1000x+ difference). Humor aside, they may both be valid ratings. Readers familiar with digg (easy example) have seen ratings ranging from the single digits, to way through the thousands. I believe there is a limit to the informativeness of the number rating. And while many services have jumped onto using similar number-based displays of popularity, here I make a case for the relative measure.<p>As a passer-by, casual reader on digg (which is most readers), when you see a page full of ratings in the hundereds, you probably process only two things from the score: the digit length and leftmost digit. When a 1000+ rating appears, you immediately know from the digit length that it is a magnitude more popular. More than what? More than the surrounding articles. Naturally, your eyes will notice the highest ratings within the page. If you reach a page full of articles rated in the thousands, readers probably apply the same strategy: scan the digit length and the leftmost digit. Unless two or more articles are rated on a higher order of magnitude than the rest, readers would likely ignore the less significant digits -- and when such a comparison is required, the articles are probably popular enough that you read them all.<p>After you mentally shift to a scale of comparison, you ignore details on other orders of magnitude; this is, for example, how your eyes adjust to consistently bright, or dark, environments. Of course numbers are easy to output and fast to read, and details may be interesting and important to the developers, but for browsing efficiency, most readers do not care, nor need to know, if something is rated 4903, or 4692, points, as long as a reference exists for comparison. And this reference will always depend on the number of participating users at a given moment. A better system should thus display only a relative measurement of popularity within a given timeframe. This idea is not necessarily new, but I believe it is definitely a better approach to popularity measurements, and moreso if you are expecting your project to eventually support a large votership.<p>An existing example to illustrate good use of this is something like a community download site. Say something is ""popular"" when over 50% of the users download it. It makes more sense then, to just write ""popular"" when total_downloads / total_users  0.5, rather than showing ""1,040 downloads!"", or even ""5,503,395 downloads!"" (okay, millions is different... but if your users were, like, ants, big deal). In the end, ""popularity"" is a relative measure.<p>I'm sure many folks here have thoughts on related issues; let's hear them :)",,8110,,,,,

I edited out the following: Richard Stanley had previously derived a rational generating function for enumerating the almost-injective functions, however, I could find no obvious way to manipulate this to obtain the limit probability distribution, nor did it suggest the decomposition of a non-machine summable formula into machine summable, asymptotically significant and non-machine-summable, asymptotically insignificant parts. The two-term formula was obtained by classifying the almost-injective functions using a regular grammar; the closed term arose from a sub-language closed under concatenation. Computer experiments suggest that a class of enumeration problems arising from regular monoids have closed form hypergeometric enumeration formulas. <p>Finding an algorithm for computing closed forms of indefinite binomial coefficient sums was an open problem in Knuth's Art of Programming; it was solved by Wilf and Zeilberger. In the example I considered, there is no closed form solution; however there is a way of finding a  decomposition of the sum with good properties.

I went to a workshop a few weeks ago that was hosted by the Stern School of Business - they had a panel of VCs and one Angel Investor, a startup business pitching to them, and an audience full of people able to ask questions. What was interesting was that one of the first questions the VCs asked after the pitch was ""do you have any patents?"" The answer was a pretty straight-forward ""no."" BUT, when asked about it later by someone in the audience, all of the VCs agreed that they didn't really care that the team didn't have anything patented - that they'd rather see a startup spending their time and energy on implementation than on developing a patent portfolio. Really, they just asked the question because they HAVE to ask the question.<p>I think the larger question here is ""why can't someone else do what you're doing?"" and the ""do you have any patents?"" question is the first logical step in answering that. But it's not the end-all be-all. I'm pretty sure Amazon's success really has very little to do with ""1-click"" and that this wan't even patented until a couple of years ago.

On the other, they can be nothing more than an expensive minefield. Shake a patent around and threaten litigation, because everyone at the end of the day will choose settlement. Law is sometimes nothing more than very expensive bullying.<p>The whole process is designed to be something like a race. Publish a paper about it or article and don't patent it on time? Tough luck! Your own damn article prevents your patent since it's ""prior work."" What constitutes patent infringement, anyway? Alexander Graham Bell wrote a patent at the time that covered just about any form of communication through an electric wire. Would a keyboard be infringing? A completed patent is still not sure proof of ""ownership"" - every patent's fate is ultimately uncertain until you really duke it out in court. They're also incredibly expensive things as well, especially for someone with just a great idea and not enough cash - $10k+ minimum, since patent applications are such complicated things and the USPTO sure likes to take its sweet time. Why not attempt trade secrets instead? <p>If you have a really amazing, great idea to patent, something that ""improves the sciences"" like they're always harping about in patent law, then sure, go for it.

If I knew how to market Granmos to the point of becoming a monopoly crushing success I would probably already be getting paid millions as a consultant.

This is the kind of thing you can do for free, but professional PR people do it better.<p>Maybe I could do something really crazy, like giving stock options to anyone who acts as an evangelist or developer.<p>As for advertising, it would mainly be cost-per-action style ads.  Affiliate links for online shops and such. You can do things like pitch a free magazine subscription offer at users. Those affiliate programs can pay $5 per action. Also there's the money you get when someone searches Google through your site. The important thing is to stick to advertisements that have some kind of benefit for the user.<p>Tracking the referrals isn't a hard problem.

I can't tell you how impatient I am to hear back!<p>I have a lot of respect for people who get college degrees. I think it says a lot about their intelligence and their ability to focus. What I can't stand however are companies that won't even look at a candidate if they don't have a degree. They miss out on truly great people. Having a degree means something, yes, but it doesn't preclude the candidate being great. <p>I have to rely on persistence and connections to get work. In  a way, it sucks but it's also a satisfying challenge. <p>When the day comes that I have to interview and hire people  I will not take their degree into consideration.

We wanted to show potential employers that we were docile and persistent enough to continue attending said elite private college, even though we had accomplished #1.<p>3. We wanted to get to know lots of other people who were willing to pay $40K/year for the privilege of #1 and #2.<p>Of course, once you get out in the working world and actually get involved in hiring decisions, you quickly learn that there's not <i>that much</i> difference in the quality of education at various universities.  Harvard's classroom instruction is not much better than any other top-tier college, and may actually be worse.  MIT's is probably better, but it's nothing that a couple of guys from UVA (ahem, Reddit) can't pick up in their spare time.<p>Instead, you look at the Education section on a resume because people have already done the hard work for you.  Someone at Harvard painstakingly went through 18 years of that candidate's life and decided that they were good enough for Harvard.  I've got code to write: I don't have time to spend digging through a candidate's background.  If it's good enough for Harvard, it's good enough for me.<p>So, the business idea I came up with was a simple certification program.  We'd look at all your test scores, administer a few additional tests, have you complete a project or two, talk to previous people you've worked with, and generally decide if you're worthy or not.  We'd set the bar high enough that the average Harvard or MIT grad would fail.  And if you pass, we give you a college degree - all without having to put up with the bullshit aspects, like going to classes or forking over a couple hundred dollars.

I'm just glad to see someone might be doing something cool to circumvent the current college standard. <p>As much as i talk about college being a big fat waste of time and money, I generally enjoyed my time spent there. I had an awesome marketing job with one of the greatest companies/brands in the world and made some stellar contacts. It was the job offers halfway through college that showed me that the experience was worth MUCH more than the diploma. Finding out that jobs that ""require"" college degrees really just require proof that you are capable and determined was a great realization. <p>If you can demonstrate to a company that you have what it takes, waiting for you to finish your degree could be a waste of time for all parties involved. <p>So if your goal is to get a good job... it is entirely possible without a degree. Your friends and family may tell you otherwise, and very few people will encourage you to drop out to take a job... but it's your decision. Having a degree hardly dictates your happiness or success as a person. <p>I ended up leaving school after 3.5 years. Not to take a job, just because it was clearly a waste of my time. I wanted to focus on starting/building my company, and school was just getting in the way of that. Incidentally I found (sorta like Seth) a way that I could get my last semester's worth of credits from my university - so i'll still have that ""all mighty piece of paper"" in a couple months.<p>My suggestion to people usually is: Do what you want! Fitting the social norm is easy and will probably work out for you, but it might not be the best choice. If I were to go to college again, I'd study something that interested me as a person. Not something that I felt was a happy medium between interesting and a safe career path. <p><i></i><i></i><i>
You should go to college to learn about something you think is cool & enjoy your time spent there. Study art or music, history of physics... something that will make you want to attend early morning class discussions. Get involved on campus, network with people, and use your free-time to read and figure out how you're going to make your mark. If you're just going to school to prepare for a job... rethink why you'd spend your time and money being lectured and quizzed on material from drab books who's curriculum is behind the times anyway. If you are planning to start a company, you'll know for yourself if college is important to you or not. <p>",,8510,,8763,,,

Despite the fact that the solution worked and that there were several engineers on staff who were Lisp programmers this did not make it through review.  A senior engineer who had been with the company for a long time (who'd never programmed in Lisp) had major objections.  He pulled the right strings and we were forced to reimplement it all in C.

A college degree is not supposed to just be a certification that you are competent over a certain domain of facts, but rather an indication that you have spent 3-4 years thinking, applying yourself, and growing intellectually.<p>While autodidactism is certainly laudable, there is value in a corporate educational setting, namely the value of intellectual interaction.  College is not so much about learning a set of data, but learning how to learn.  (For the ultimate example, consider the Ph.D., a degree meant only to teach you to do research, and requiring legitimate research to attain it.)<p>Now, I'll admit, I was educated in a liberal arts[1] high school, and am currently pursuing a couple of liberal arts degrees.  That is both why and because I believe education is about thinking, not committing facts to memory.  I eschew academic engineering because it is (at my university, at least) primarily a series of courses that certify your knowledge of yet another parcel of facts.  That is useless, educationally.  As technical training,[2] great, but it's not education.<p>Your list of ""why""s implies that, substantively, you were no different at the end of college than at the beginning, modulo a group of friends, and four years aging.  If that is the case, I'm terribly sorry; you managed to miss most of your education.<p>[0] Mea culpa: this entire comment is a bit hot-headed.  You've hit a pet peeve.
[1] Before you jump to conclusions:  the liberal arts include the hard sciences.
[2] In all honesty, that's what engineering school is: a vocational education in an incredibly advanced vocation.

If you work hard, you have a stab of reaching awesomehood. If you don't work hard, you are guaranteed to suck. The risks/benefits are clear. Work hard.<p>The problem is, some people's brains wire faster than others. And when speed is all the concern, some others are quickly deterred from attempting what they may eventually excel at.

Short answer, yes.<p>First, the way things are structured tax-wise, C corporations get to deduct founder health insurance 100%, so that's the most tax-advantaged scenario.  If you pay for your own personal health insurance or do it as a sole proprietorship, etc. you're basically getting a raw deal from Congress.<p>I'm in California, where basically any 2+ person small business that's been around about like 3-6 months is guaranteed group health insurance for its employees at no more than 10% over an index that represents what bigger companies pay.  It's a sweet deal.  So if you're in California and are going to go this route, you may want to incorporate ahead of time to start that clock ticking.<p>So basically the company pays for the insurance for the founders, even though they're not drawing a salary.

My high school was basically founded around that premise, and I completely bought into it then.  IMNSHO <i>now</i>, it's complete bullshit.<p>You don't learn how to learn by having someone teach you.  You learn how to learn by butting your head up against a problem, reading everything you can about what other people have already done on the problem, trying different approaches until one works, and moving on to the next problem.  After you've repeated this a few hundred times, you start figuring out which approaches are likely to work and which aren't.<p>The Ph.D is a good example.  There are plenty of people that are ""ABD"" (All But Dissertation) - they've gone through all the coursework, been taught all that their instructors can teach them, but nobody considers them ""real"" Ph.Ds.  Why?  Because the meat of a Ph.D program is actually going out and <i>doing original research</i>, and someone who hasn't done the research doesn't really know how to do the research.<p>The point of a certification program is to decouple the act of learning from the act of judging how much has been learned.  Right now, universities perform both functions, which in any other industry would be a ludicrous conflict of interest.

Many people who are currently students may be able to use this, and have their coverage be at no or very low cost.<p>For those people who don't qualify, As on May 1st there's a new program, Common Choice, which will be a private-public partnership, to try to bring 4 or 5 low-cost health care plans to everyone. Given that everyone in the state now needs health care, essentially the state is negotiating it's own group rates.<p>It's not a bad system, but it's still new. The Poor are covered for free. Employers with over 12 people are required to offer Health Insurance. People who work alone, or in a small startup, can get a plan for ~ $120/month.<p><a href=""http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=hichomepage&L=1&L0=Home&sid=Qhic"">http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=hichomepage&L=1&L0=Home&sid=Qhic</a>

If you catch pneumonia or the flu, you're looking at getting knocked out for 2 months (pneumonia resulting from a ""cold"" that was not properly handled), 2 weeks (flu) without medical intervention.  Personally, I'd rather take some meds and be back on my feet in 3-5 days than not be able to afford to see a doc or take some meds....putting my startup behind which would kill me more than an illness.  Without insurance you're looking at least $110 for per doctor visit and about $90 bucks and up depending on what meds you need (PER prescription). Or let's say you broke your arm or leg because you tripped on your shoe laces while walking down the stairs of the Y Combinator building.   Without insurance you're looking at about $2500 and up to get it fixed and that doesn't include the cost of seeing a doctor added into it.<p>Paying $120 bucks a month to cover potential injuries or finding affordable medical insurance and covering yourself for potential injuries is a definitely an important factor not only for yourself, your company, but also to prevent you from getting your co-founders sick.  <p>It is true that if you're younger you are less likely to get sick.  However, if you are under a substantial amount of stress, your immune defense will drop and your chances of getting sick increases.  That's why you see a lot of people get sick during mid terms and exams.<p>So for all of you who are in a startup, I suggest you get at least 1000-2000mg of Vitamin C. Clinical trials have shown that taking 1000-2000mg (usually an 8oz glass of OJ, depending on type of OJ) of Vitamin C a day provides prophylactic use (prevents the occurrence) against acute stress induced illnesses.<p><p><p><p>",,8703,,8819,,,

If you go to a ""doctor's office"" he has the right to deny you services if you can't pay (only for non-emergency incidences).  However, if you are in an extreme emergency such as a heart attack or you're dying, he cannot refuse you his services due to the hippocratic oath.<p>However, doctors in hospitals are different.  If you go to the ER (hospital related) the hospital doctor is REQUIRED to see you by US law...without verification of ability to pay.   For doctors in hospitals, this is a big problem because we cater to a lot of homeless patients who walk out and do not pay...and of course one can't do anything about it since they're homeless.<p>Anywhoo, if you get treated in a HOSPITAL, always request an ITEMIZED list of charges.

I got the feeling you tried to show too many features too quickly.<p>In general, I have realized it is much better to launch with something that does a few things REALLY well rather than a lot of things with little focus. When you launch with whole lot of features people assume you are competing with the big companies. When you launch small and do it well, it is easier to attract a user-base and THEN keep feeding it more advance features in form of updates.<p>Good luck! Looks slick from the UI.

This is what MySpace and GeoCities do- They let the user upload whatever they want, no matter how it might look. The users focus on content rather on the looks.

This is what WordPress, Drupal, and other CMS do. The default templates look decent, and editing them is hard for mere mortals, requiring HTML or Scripting.

I didn't know him. I didn't look at a resume. I had one conversation with him. I just read his blog, and I could tell from his writing that he would do a good job. Actually, his blog was just his fiction writing and he was a UI designer and coder but I could still tell from his thinking. He was so smart--a structured, logical, deep and creative thinker. It was clear to me that he would do a good job. He did. I tend to be a perfectionist, and he was the only person I've ever hired that did a perfect job. I had absolutely no criticisms about him. He always exceeded my expectations. It was amazing. I love working with the best people--nothing is more fun.  <p>If they didn't have a blog, I'd tell them to write down their thoughts every day for a few weeks and then I'd read it. I believe that you can't tell anything about anyone except how they behave over time. People lie and misrepresent themselves. But it's pretty much impossible to misrepresent yourself over a period of time. <p>I might try and give them a few of my problems to work on as well. But, if someone isn't the quickest thinker and can't answer a problem I give them in an hour-long interview I really don't care. What if they're amazing problem solvers but they just take overnight? One of the smartest people I know is like this. <p>With a blog, or writing over time, you also get a sense of how well they can articulate their ideas--if they have amazing ideas but they can't articulate them well, then the quality of their ideas doesn't matter. If for some reason they're terrible writers but still smart, you can just have them create a podcast. If they can't do either, then they can't articulate themselves enough to be useful to a company.<p>Watching their thinking over time, you can see how many ideas they generate, since you don't just want people that will only solve the problems you have. You want people that see things you can't and generate ideas themselves. <p>I don't care about how well people fit in. A start-up isn't a clique of best friends, although you certainly need people that you can be bluntly honest with and can be bluntly honest with you. It's better if you like them, of course, but I'm never trying to build any kind of culture except a culture of excellence--well, excellence on deadline. <p>Another thing I've always wanted to try is just to hire someone for two weeks and give them non-critical tasks to do. I could see if they met deadlines and how they actually worked. The best way of finding out if someone can do something is to watch her do it. <p>

The Rick is offering the founder shares in his own company as compensation for not taking a salary!  <p>The inherent assumption behind this asinine perspective is that ""Preferred"" shares are for VCs only... but the reality is that VCs offer nothing to warrant such preferences.   Everyone who has put sweat equity into the company is just as much an investor, and is generally taking on more risk... but the VC expects to be given preferences because such terms are common, and they are common because too many startups cave because they are addicted to the cash.<p>Love that the liquidation preference is ""only"" 1X.  The reality is that it is screwing over all the other investors in the company by saying that the VC goes to the front of the line, gets all their money back, and <i>then</i> gets the percentage of anything left over comensurate with their percentage ownership of the company.   The implication being that employees have not actually invested in the company and if there's anything left over, then the employees and founders get some. <p>This is particularly insulting given that the liklihood of this preference being relevant is increased by taking VC money-- which in this day and age means forgoing almost certain profitability for a higher risk shot at hitting it out of the ballpark. <p>And the price for putting a bomb under your company and lighting the fuse?

Stick with angels.  Give everyone common- recognize that investors who are only putting in money are fairly compensated by getting shares at a fair valuation.

However, all the hacking I hear about in relation to startups is either a) UI design (e.g. Wufoo) or b) server scaling.

9150,comment,dageroth,1175773242,"I don't think that a central authority is necessary for money to work, at least not in form of a monopolist. Actually the current systems are rather unsatisfying because a state can loose its credibility and thus the trust in its curreny quite fast, basically as soon as war looms on the horizon or it becomes apparent that it will default on its debt. In the last 25 years over 87 currencies crashed.
And because of the monopoly of the state on money the whole economy is usually going down along. For my part I would therefore abandon the monetary monopoly of the state and allow competition, allow companies to issue money. When they connect their name to the currency and have no legal power to make their money legal tender they will have a much stronger incentive to provide a good and stable money. Hayek wrote a fascinating treatise on the denationalisation of money, and with the ongoing globalisation sooner or later we will get used to juggle with more than one currency in our pockets. Second Life seems to be a step in the direction that companies start to issue private currencies and when states, especially in the developing countries, will fail to keep their currency stable chances are that they will be replaced by private currencies. <p>Equally interesting and probably easier to believe are gold backed currencies with competing private institutes issuing goldbacked money.<p>Still, its great to see people thinking about money in another way than just how to get it.

These macros give the programmer the power to create entirely new, domain-specific languages without too much difficulty.<p>I am currently a Master's student and I hope to eventually be a founder, and my question is the title of this submission.  I can understand why some people would shy away from Lisp, but I also see how many upcoming programmers appreciate the power of Python and Ruby.  I believe, then, that the next big language will be one that combines the macros of Lisp with the ease of use of Python.  I think that such a language would be perfect for startups.<p>I am a glutton for punishment, so my graduate interests lie in programming languages.  Here at Ohio State University, there is a language called RESOLVE that a lot of students don't like too much (it's built on top of C++ and is much too wordy), but it does have some interesting concepts built-in that I would like to put in a language of my own.

You either win a Fellowship, you teach a class, you help a professor with his research, or you do grunt work like grading papers and labs.  In any case, tuition, fees, and 80% of health insurance is covered, in addition to a $1600-1850 per month stipend.  That works out to a respectable $20k/yr.<p>If you do not get a Fellowship, you are expected to perform 20 hours worth of work per week (which you actually receive credit for), in addition to your time spent on classes and on your own independent research.<p>In other words, grad school is more like a low-paying job than a cost.  You could make the case that you could be working a higher-paying job in that time, but then you are missing out on the flexibility of being a Ph.D., which allows the possibility of being a professor or getting hired for a pretty high income.  Additionally, you have the opportunity to leave your mark on the field with your research.<p>Even more interesting is that Ph.D. work could lead you to your startup idea, as you unveil a new use of existing technology or a new approach altogether which leads to a money-making possibility.  Furthermore, if you are exceptionally driven, you may be able to get some work done on your startup idea while attending grad school, because at least so far, I have found grad school to be significantly easier than my undergrad was, because I am taking less ""real"" classes.",,7908,,,,,

Alternative syntaxes have never taken hold in the Lisp world, which <i>may</i> mean they just offer nothing to an experienced Lisp hacker, but they're certainly not impossible.<p>You can have user-definable infix operators; Haskell has them and uses them to good effect. (The way Haskell does it, you can't have identifiers composed of both letters and operator characters, which Lisp people like to do, but I think we can safely treat that as a matter of taste.) You pick a symbol, say ~, and assign it a precedence and left- or right-associativity:<p>infixr 3 ~<p>infixl 7 .!.<p>Now (x ~ y .!. z) is parsed as ((~) x ((.!.) y z)), where (~) is the Haskell way of making the ~ operator as a prefix function. Haskell also lets you use a prefix function as an infix operator, by putting backquotes around it.<p>If you want to apply this in Lisp, there is the issue that (foo) means something else than foo; I would like to allow (foo x + bar y) to mean ((+) (foo x) (bar y)), but I wouldn't want (x + y) to mean ((+) (x) (y)). My solution would be that a single value is parsed as just a value, but multiple values next to each other is a function call: (foo x + y) is ((+) (foo x) y), to call y without parameters you have to write (foo x + (y)).<p>This leaves you with the parantheses for control structures and the like. If you like layout-based languages, you can adopt the rule that ""expression + colon + newline + indented expression 1 + indented expression 2 + ..."" is parsed as  ""expression (indented expression 1) (indented expression 2) ..."".<p>Some examples of code from On Lisp formatted like this:<p><a href=""http://himalia.it.jyu.fi/~benja/2007/layoutedlisp.txt"">http://himalia.it.jyu.fi/~benja/2007/layoutedlisp.txt</a><p>Of course, it still looks like Lisp, with less parens.",,9236,,,,,

It's also available on O'Reilly's safari service.<p>. <i>Universal Principles of Design: 100 Ways to Enhance Usability, Influence Perception, Increase Appeal, Make Better Design Decisions, and Teach Through Design</i>. This book will help you build your design vocabulary and better understand concepts in design that you likely haven't thought of.  It will help you describe the ways in which this page - <a href=""http://www.sandstromdesign.com/nav.html"">http://www.sandstromdesign.com/nav.html</a> - sucks (it lacks external consistency and it contains interference effects, to begin with).  The book has a great format, describing a topic on one page with visual examples on the following page.  The descriptions are short of enough that you can read them in about 4 minutes.<p>. <a href=""http://www.hallwaytesting.com"">http://www.hallwaytesting.com</a> - this is actually my own site.  You can post your site for usability feedback and give usability feedback.  Live usability tests allow you to get more details, but the users on my site also give valuable feedback, and it doesn't cost you any money or nearly as much time.  I try to give feedback for as many sites as possible and am usually pretty thorough about it. Users have told me that the site has helped them a lot.<p>
=== The Seller ===<p>. <a href=""http://www.marketingexperiments.com"">http://www.marketingexperiments.com</a> . This site is absolutely the best web development resource I've found, ever.  It contains articles on developing a unique value proposition, doing competitive analysis on the Internet, and of course actually marketing your site using PPC, SEO, and other online marketing techniques.  Perhaps the most valuable thing I learned from this site is that online marketing <i>is</i> online testing.<p>. <i>How to Win Friends and Influence People</i>, by Dale Carnegie.  For a long time I didn't want to read this book because I thought doing so would make me a sleaze ball.  Instead it's made me a more effective communicator.  When you think about it, honing our skills in most areas involves learning how to communicate with other humans better.  As The Tech Wizard it's essential that you communicate the purpose of your code.   As The Artist it's essential you communicate the purpose of a site and each of its elements.  As The Seller you must know how to communicate value.  Dale Carnegie's book will show you how to effectively communicate value.

What will advertising look like as video programming and advertising dollars shift to the web? Where are those advertising dollars going to go, who will decide on the content these dollars will fund, and who will provide this content?<p>I think the most important thing Garfield notes in this article is the huge shift in power has occurred with the advent of dvr and web video. People don't have to sit through flashy, in-your-face ads that shout 'buy me!.' These ads can be fast-forwarded or deleted. On the web, the attention span of the viewer is drastically reduced by the sheer volume and choice of content. Why would I watch an ad when I don't have to on this site over here? The audience is no longer captive. The student has become the teacher. We are in charge. <p>Advertising and networks are not doomed in any sense.  However, traditional, 'flashy' ads will have to be replaced by more informative, interactive, gentle, pull advertising content. Think product placement, contests, video games, informational videos... Ad content will also be interactive-the best way to extend the short-attention span of the average web user. Just because networks are reeling in costs does in no way mean that they are 'over.'  
  
Yes, traditional purveyors of advertising and large networks should be concerned, but only if they do not adapt to this huge shift in power. These networks and ad companies became successful because of innovation and I am sure they will temper the storm. However, who should be taking close note of this market shift is ambitious independent producers and content providers. There is a huge gap in the market for a few companies to sneak in and make an absolute killing. <p>To summarize: Because the viewer is in charge, ads in the future will inform rather than entertain, engage rather than impress, so really, the only question to answer is, what do the end users want to know and from whom?
I believe local expertise and endorsement to be the untapped goldmine of this 'new' advertising.",,6636,,,,,

However, that's totally unnecessary! I've certainly done that when I was a teen, but have found the charitable approach much more effective. Let me be clear that 'charitable' does not mean unclear or deceptive in the breakup. On the contrary - it's being very clear and honest about the breakup with the girl. That being said, you <i>do</i> withhold any information that would unnecessarily hurt her (ex: you're not attracted to something about her that she can't help).<p>The breakup needs to establish that:<p>1) the relationship is not a match for you, but that that is no reflection on her personally in the slightest<p>2) you genuinely admire the N number of amazing things about her<p>3) you hope that you both can still be good friends, but that you understand and honor her wish if she thinks it's better not to<p>4) the romantic possibilities of your relationship are just not there sufficient for marriage and never will be (let her move on with closure!) Don't worry, if you change your mind later you can crawl back on your knees to her and tell her you were wrong - but you have to let her go and pursue other possibilities.<p>5) you are open to talk with her about it at any time - this will usually relieve a lot of her anxiety about having to wonder why you broke up later.<p>Note: Be careful about the 'still being friends' thing. If you are hanging out too much with her, most other guys will avoid asking her out - and you don't want to hinder her ability to move on. Be sure to honor her space and let her know that you are doing that so she doesn't feel rejected by it.<p>Success stories:<p>2004 girlfriend: Good breakup, she decided it was better for her to not have contact. I honored that and imagine she has gone on to great things.<p>2005 girlfriend: Good breakup, though we did get back together several times. Ultimately it ended, but our communication was so good that we have remained best friends since then and talk regularly about our new relationships. We both are huge advocates of each other - she sells me to other girls and I sell her to other guys. We do business together too since there is such a high level of trust.<p>2006 girlfriend: Had a great time together, but we both knew it wouldn't work. We had great communication and though it was hard for me to let her go, I did and that really impressed her to the point where we have a similar high-trust, high-advocate relationship as with 2005 girlfriend.<p>2007 girlfriend: Ended about a week ago. So far so good. Very hard for both of us. But we've had good communication since and it is evolving well into a good friend relationship.<p>Note that these tips assume that you are only dating reasonably sane girls - with psycho chics this probably won't apply ;)<p>It's important to remember that going the charitable route is often harder in the short-term than the alternatives, but it's important to suck it up and have the kahoonas to do it right. Some guys may be tempted to not give her a clean break or feel they have to diminish her as a person to satisfy their own insecurities. DON'T DO IT! Seriously, it will hammer your karma and make life much more difficult for you in the long-term. To illustrate: 2006 girlfriend only dated me because of the good things 2005 girlfriend told her about how good our relationship and breakup was. The same with 2007 girlfriend.

As you may guess we got an email from YC in late October saying: <p>---
"" We're sorry to say that we can't accept your proposal for funding.
Please don't take it personally, because most of the proposals we
rejected, we rejected for reasons having nothing to do with the
quality of the applicants.  For example, we were very reluctant to
accept proposals with only one founder, because we think starting
a startup is too much work for one person.  We also rejected a lot
of proposals simply because we couldn't understand them, or didn't
understand the problem domain well enough to judge them, or because
the project seemed too big to start on only three months of funding.<p>We realize this process is fraught with error. It's practically
certain that groups we rejected will go on to create successful
startups.  If you do, we'd appreciate it if you'd send us an email

---<p>We told ourselves that wasn't going to stop us.... but it sorta did for a while. I wasn't done with school, but was getting dream job offers, and my co-founder was enjoying his software development job. So we didn't do much for a few months. We just kept talking about our idea for Revvu.<p>In doing some soul searching though, I decided I had to turn down these job offers and stop wasting time in school. This is not the life I wanted. After talking to my co-founder we came to grips with the fact that... working regular jobs was the default. That was the easy way to go about life, but we wanted more than that. We are too creative and determined to be held back or stifled by the nuances of a ""job"". <p>In January I moved across the country to live with my co-founder and work full time on our project. Shortly after that we had a full business plan, and were testing our site in closed beta. As of this week we've launched publicly and are getting encouraging user feedback. <p>We are beginning to tap our network to find potential investors, so that we can grow the business significantly in the next 12 moths. <p>About a week ago my co-founder brought up YCombinator for the first time in months, and we decided to apply at the last minute. Not because we NEED the living expenses, we both have savings. Also, not because we need it to feel like we're doing something. We're already confident that we're doing something, and we'll peruse other sourced of funding if we don't get YC. We applied because we know we could benefit from the mentoring, the guidance, the connections, and i guess partially because not draining our bank accounts just to eat would be kinda nice.<p>If the author had good intentions, IMHO, we might be a model for what he was trying to communicate. We weren't ready before. We were sitting around waiting to hear back from YC in October, and nearly let our passion fade after not being accepted. <p>This time filling out the application didn't take long at all, because we actually knew our answers. This time we have a real plan for our business and legitimately strive towards success.<p>If we get YC... awesome, if not... thats fine too. <p>I hope many of you are in the same boat. I hope you're building something you believe is great, and nothing will stop you. Don't get discouraged. Don't let anything slow you down.

head full of a complete proof of the Riemann
hypothesis. (This is arguably the greatest
open problem in mathematics, and is a deep
statement about the distribution of the prime
numbers, the atoms of arithmetic.) Giddy with
anticipation of certain fame, you leap out of
bed and type up the proof, in its full 500-page
glory. That done, you are seized by doubt. How
wise is it to inflict the full brunt of your genius
on your colleagues? Will anyone even listen, or
be prepared to check your proof?<p>What you can do is re-format your write-up
into a (somewhat longer) PCP proof. Anyone
now wishing to verify your argument need only
pick a handful of words at random, and follow a
set list of instructions to conclude whether it is
correct or not. An error might have slipped in
on account of faulty working, buggy reformatting,
or outright cheating. No matter, it will be
caught with overwhelming probability. What
the reformatting step does is smear any error
all over the proof, making it easier to spot. In
much the same way, a diligent sandwich maker
will smear a smidgen of jam evenly over his
bread, rather than leaving it concentrated
in one corner, and so make the whole more
savoury.<p>...In its full splendour, PCP asserts that
any statement S whose validity can be ascertained
by a proof P written over n bits also
admits an alternative proof, Q. This proof Q
has two appealing features: it can be derived
from P in a number of steps proportional to
n^c, where c is some constant; and P can be verified
by examining only three bits of Q picked
at random. If S is true, a correct P will satisfy
the verifier with a probability of 99%. If it is not
true, any alleged proof P will trigger a rejection
from Q with a probability higher than 50%
(ref. 4). Not impressed with this error rate?
Then all you have to do is pick, instead of three
bits of Q, as many bits as are contained in this
line of text. The error probability will drop to
one in a billion.""",,9465,,,,,

For the first 2-3 years, it was all part-time of 2-4 days a week but, for the past decade, it's been full-time. <p>I tell you - even 12 years on, it is still hard to do. I do a lot of traveling  as a consultant and trainer and these are usually Monday through Friday gigs. When I get back to the ""office"" and start to work again on Monday, I've totally lost the groove lol. That's it - it only takes a week of me getting out of the mindset of working at home to lose it.

Distractions are huge at home but, for a 20-something with no significant other, they are less so. Now, I have a spouse and a fun little three year old at home - those are more distracting than all the strip clubs and PS3s in the world lol. But you manage. <p>Last bit - I would suggest that, when you are looking for a spouse/significant other, make sure that person is okay with a comment like, ""Honey, I'm going into work now. I want you to think as though my office is 30 miles away from you and you can't just walk in and ask me a question. Send me an email or phone me if you have a question.

I'd wager the best YC applications contain a degree of hyperbole, because no one wants to get involved with something that isn't exciting.<p>Finally, words are the simplest way to express logic, so I'm glad we could find some common ground. If you go back and read my original comment you'll see I wasn't attacking you. I wasn't even disagreeing with you. I was simply adding my insight to your original post, which is lost now because you continue to edit or delete what you say. I'm not going to debate this any further with you, because I am starting to feel foolish being dragging into this.<p>So again, I am sorry if you felt attacked, that was not my intention.<p>Best wishes,<p>Clinton<p>PS - I've taken the liberty of copying and pasting your post below so you won't feel compelled to edit it.<p>	0 points by voiceofreason 10 hours ago | link | parent
How DARE you call me a liar? You work in a PR firm, so you use WORDS. I use LOGIC.<p>The point of my thread was that the author was being a jerk to Paul and should apologize. When I posted the quote where it's clear the author is insulting Paul, you got all uppity about it.<p>""your initial comment said that the author should apologize for comparing Paul to the musician.""<p>At what point did I deny that I ""compared Paul to the musician?"" I never claimed I never said that. I simply replied to you and posted his quote you might have missed where the author said ""YC is a waste of time"" and also says, Paul is a bull who speaks ""shit"". That's why I said the author should apologize.<p>The author obviously meant to say Steve instead of Paul, in the intro. I didn't confuse that part of the article like you arrogantly believed. The reason I compared the two is because the user shows disdain and hate for the YC, so much he even confused his friend and Paul's names, when the two had nothing to do with one another.<p>You work in public relations so you're probably very good at attacking people. You're a liar and exaggerate by trade.<p>Do you understand it now? Or are you attacking me just because you're a PR person trying to test your training?

The post has been thoroughly critiqued here, but I did want to add on thing that came to mind as I was reading through the discussion.<p>YC is a model that was created based on expereince and success.  The value of YC funding is not the money, $5-20 k is not hard to save or raise.   <p>It has been encouraging and interesting to hear from so many people, who obviously find a lot of value in VC's approach, offering slight variances based on their personal situation.<p>It is important to take what is valuable from a model and apply it to your own startup situation.  If you can implement the use the best concepts and models from other and apply them to your unique startup, you will reduce the chance of failure and save a ton of time and money. <p>If you fallow blindly and base your success on one groups acceptance your not an entrepreneur.

For example, enterprise data integration (conversion between data stored in heterogeneous formats and systems), or natural language translation/processing. Many startups in information management / data warehousing: if you build a Teradata killer, the UI is certainly a component of your product, but it is pretty secondary. A startup building hardware (say, networking stuff) might not need to pay much attention to the UI, depending on the target market. etc.<p>If by ""startup"" you just mean ""implementing the Web 2.0 idea-of-the-week"", then yeah, I agree UI is usually pretty important.",,9646,,,,,

True, no product campaign these days is complete without a rebranding of the web itself. <p>As advertising has undergone a power shift, from the content providers to the users, advertising has somehow become a bad word. Now that end users decide what and how products will be pitched, advertising seems to stand not only for traditional, flashy, in-your-face ads, but for any product communication that has already occurred. In that sense,  advertising is perpetually over, and therefore always omnipresent.  <p>Simply put, as more and more people research products and services online, making purchasing decisions online, and actually buy online, it seems preposterous to claim that advertising, and companies that are in the business of advertising, are in anyway passe. It is inconsistent with the evolution of the web. <p>What I like about Komisar-backed Aggregate Knowledge is that it is creating the platform for some wonderful advertising streams. Right now, as I understand it, they are touting as part of their product targeting by the Psychology of Crowds, or the beginning of building psychological profiles of buyers. This is done on many shopping sites: If person 1 buys product A, then he will, based on group research, be interested in product B and product C and should be presented with B and C in a non-obtrusive fashion.  
What this should naturally evolve into is a better targeting-being able to differentiate between types of buyers; is she an impulse buyer that might be wooed by a flashy interface, or is she a research shopper, who needs a case study to buy? Merely providing relevant content, without the proper packaging for the individual (what I think to be the advertising formerly know as advertising) is deficient.   
Also, what is the ideal interface complexity of this shopper? For instance, in person people buy less in big stores because they are overwhelmed by the sheer number of options. They are more likely to buy products in a smaller store. People are more influenced by items placed at the front of the store as their shopping goals are more malleable as they enter. Not to say that these findings will translate directly to shopping behavior on the web, but we will soon have the ability to create the perfect shopping environment for an individual, and advertising will be big part of it.

The problem was that they kept adding new features to their excel documents, rather than accepting that excel was Great at what it did [1], but it wasn't the right solution for them any more.<p>Eventually, if I recall, they finally got it all moved over to a series of Access databases, which made things a lot nicer.<p>Could Microsoft add features to Excel to make it easier for them to keep pushing it?

9736,comment,rms,1175896767,"Cure HIV:
Start with some adult stem cells from the HIV patient to be treated, specifically the stem cells that produce T cells. We introduce the 32 base pair deletion in the CCR5 gene and grow the cells in culture. These can then be ""transplanted"" back into the patient. These transplanted stem cells will create HIV immune T cells. Once there are enough immune T cells, the patient will probably still have HIV, but it will not develop into AIDS. There will be no chance of rejection since they are the patient's own cells. Furthermore, since the body does produce antibodies to HIV, these modified T cells may even be able to fight off the HIV.<p>To test this, we would get a mouse line, which are genetically very similar to each other from inbreeding so we won't have to worry about rejection of the transplants, and introduce the human CCR5 receptor into them. This, in theory, will allow the mice to be infected with HIV since HIV attaches to the CCR 5 receptor to enter and infect the cell. If this works, we can then try the technique of taking some of their stem cells, introducing the mutation, transplanting them back in, and see if their T cell count increases or if the levels of HIV decrease. It could also be used as a preventative therapy, which we can also easily test on the mice.",,9711,,,,,

I agree with many of the things that you say, but the fact of the matter is that much of the economy - domestic and global - runs in a Windows environment.  Most consumers still run Windows.  Am I missing the point?  Perhaps.  I suppose it is true that anybody who takes personal computing seriously is running Firefox and Thunderbird and Google Desktop on Windows.  In that sense, yeah Windows is dead.  Personally, I use Macs, so I am well insulated from Microsoft.  However, they are alive and well if only because of the Office suite.  If I send a an OpenDocument file to ten of my friends, they won't be able to open it.  If I send a Word file, everybody can open it.  The point is, Microsoft is still quite relevant today.  Although, I can see your points and would fully agree that free Linux could easily supplant Windows as a desktop environment (to run your stated Web 2.0 apps) or Macs.  I applaud your essay; you take some interesting positions and provide some profound insight.  Very interesting.  Brad Engelmann.

9864,comment,blader,1175915724,"It depends on your software. In general, here are some questions I like to myself when I design a product in order to keep it simple:<p>1. What is the product supposed to do? A corollary is to ask, what can a user do with my product that he can't do without it? The answer to these questions should be a single, simple, focused answer.<p>2. What is the absolute minimum feature set we must have in order for the product to do what the user needs? Question EVERYTHING. If you're designing an email product, ask yourself if you even need folders. If you're designing a MS Word killer, ask yourself if you even need a Save. If you're designing a media player, ask yourself if even need a play/pause button.<p>After you have the minimum feature set, release the software and iterate quickly based on user feedback. Nothing can replace raw feedback from strangers who don't give a crap about you or your product. See what the users like and dislike about the product, based on first hand observation. <p>More tricky is keeping the product simple in response to user feature demands. Adding features is good, but only when you do it in such a way that it complements your answer to the original question: ""What is the product supposed to do?"" <p>You have to think about how each and every additional feature deeply integrates into your existing product, rather than tacking features on haphazardly.

Interest rates for business loans are what, 6-8%?  It's not uncommon for a well-run, growing business with a strong franchise to earn a ROC of about 25%.  <p>Debt lets them grow faster, sooner, and then they can pay off the debt from future earnings.  It's often far more capital-efficient than floating an equity offering, where the investors would get a share of all those additional profits.<p>It doesn't work for web startups because web startups often have far lumpier earnings.  It's not uncommon for a web startup to be bought for multi-millions before they earn a dime of profit.  That's because their real ""customers"" are big companies, who are paranoid about losing their market to an upstart.  A web startups users are effectively an advertising expense: spend a few thousand on bandwidth to show that if you wanted, you could take over the world, and then get a big company to buy you to prevent that from happening.<p>There are some web startups that employ debt financing very effectively.  For example, Akamai floated close to $300M of convertible bonds to fund its expansion.  As a result, it effectively acquired a lock on the content-delivery business, which has allowed it to grow by leaps and bounds over the past 5 years.

Instead of going with their suggestion, we defended our own.<p>They also spent a lot of the interview comparing our product to yahoo.com which was another direction we didn't think the interview would go.<p>In the end, we were rejected because we didn't have a functioning demo. It was a dumb move on our part, and I would say a demo is an absolute must for the interview. I really regret making it as far as we did and not having a demo. We threw away our opportunity. I've heard that one demo-less team was told at their interview to make a demo in the next 24 hours, so be prepared for a serious test of your ability to get things done if you don't have a demo. Being undergrads didn't help us either. If you're an undergraduate, make it clear to the YCs that you are absolutely committed to starting a company and that you intend to drop out and work on it whether or not you get funding from them.<p>For me, it's all moot because I got myself banned from Y Combinator after I made a really dumb Techcrunch comment.

I think the path is really very straightforward.   Assuming you're a developer, get a job, preferably with a local startup.  Live really cheap. Work really hard, save %50 of your gross income.  Do this for 6 months to a year and you won't need YC or TS funding.<p>In the evenings and weekends, build your idea. <p>If you've got funding to finish your university degree, then build your idea in your spare time and stay in school.  Not as good, but a number of stratups have come out of college started projects (eg: napster, facebook.) <p>The really important thing is not so much your idea, but the skills that will come with trying to make your idea a success.<p>Trying to make it a success and totally failing is much more valuable than getting a job writing enterprise software or staying in school. <p>Assuming you're an engineer, and your idea is a web based one, you don't need money- you don't need investment-- what you need is living expenses.  Get that covered and you're in a no lose situation.  (Just make  sure you have something to show for it if it fails- so that you can use the  epxerience to get a job if you need one....)<p>",,9916,,,,,

It's still way too convenient to have hundreds of programs a mouse-click away, and to be able to fire up 50 of them at once on new hardware without any lag.  It is true, however, that that desktop needn't be Windows anymore.<p>I agree that OS X has been partly responsible for converting people away from Windows, but equally responsible is a growing Linux community.  Since Linux came out, it has been slowly gaining some of Microsoft's desktop market share, especially since Gnome and KDE have gotten more polished and Ubuntu made its number 1 bug Microsoft.<p>I was a bit disappointed to see no mention of open source software, because it is not Google Docs that is replacing MS Office, but Open Office.  GIMP has been slowly replacing Photoshop since it came out, not Snipshot.  Likewise with Firefox overtaking Internet Explorer, Thunderbird being the first to stand in for Outlook, and gcc has been the compiler of choice for years.<p>In summary, I agree that Microsoft is on the decline and that we are seeing software shift to the Internet, but I never think the desktop will go away.  The number of desktops running Windows and other Microsoft software, however, is going to continue to decline.

That updater component could be configured once, instead of having to configure each application individually. There is also the additional concern of letting applications communicate through a firewall - if I unblock them so they can get their bloody updates, who knows what else they will transmit?

9987,comment,BrandonM,1175941823,"I read about the fallout from that announcement sometime last year.  By announcing that they were giving back money to their shareholders, they opened the door for savvy stock market gurus.  These guys milked it for all it was worth by first loading up on the stock in order to get the cash from the dividends.  Because all these people were buying the stock, its price became artificially inflated, so they proceeded to borrow against the stock at this point (in order to short-sell later).  Then the dividends came, and they got the $3/share from Microsoft.  Immediately after this, they proceeded to sell the stocks that got them the dividends, which led to the stock price falling sharply.  Finally, to round it all out, they proceeded to make good on the short-sells once the stocks were low, leading to a nice profit all-around.<p>I wish I remembered where I read about this scheme; it sounded pretty brilliant to me.  I always wondered, though, if a bunch of people playing the stock market profited from this, who lost out?  I guess the long-time shareholders and Microsoft, itself.",,9908,,,,,

9991,comment,mattjaynes,1175942443,"Wow, this is awesome. Unfortunately it will probably be a good wait before this is built and released to the public.<p>In the meantime, I've been developing a framework using EC2, S3, S3DFS (DFS = Distributed File System) along with SQLite to try and solve the database problem on AWS. <p>S3DFS allows you to mount an S3 bucket to one or multiple EC2 instances as if it were a local filesystem. It works at the block level and has read/write caching - so is very fast. (Note: It's free to use for development, but otherwise requires a paid commercial license.)<p>Since SQLite uses flat files and has no database server or client, it is ideal for use on S3. SQLite only scales well to a point, so to get around its limitations I am separating each user into their own database (each database is a separate flat file). This can sometimes be a bad idea, but SQLite allows you to attach multiple databases together to essentially create a temporary master database where you can run queries across all the user databases at once. This will be handy for search indexing, site-wide stats, etc. In order to change the user databases I will have utilities to allow global scheme alterations.<p>So, by adding EC2 instances that are all attached to the same S3 bucket, and using round-robin dns to distribute traffic among them, you can theoretically scale a web service infinitely. Just launch a new EC2 instance and add it to the round-robin dns pool and you're done! Even that could be automated to respond dynamically to traffic.<p>Imagine the long-term cost-savings from only having to build your app and architecture once and not having to go through a more complex scaling process like this: <a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/21793/Scaling-PHPMySQL-Presentation-from-Flickr"">http://www.scribd.com/doc/21793/Scaling-PHPMySQL-Presentation-from-Flickr</a><p>Certainly you should only worry about scaling after your app is up and running, but what if you didn't have to ever worry about it?

10000,comment,BrandonM,1175945037,"I think the article does a good job of conveying what Lisp is to someone who just can't get it.  I agree, however, that it is a bit on the verbose side.  I think that at least a third of the text could have been removed without taking out any content.  Heck, some of the content could have probably been removed without taking away from the point the author is trying to convey.<p>To make the analogy even more succinct, I will first ask you a different question.  Have you switched to Firefox?  It wasn't long ago that I went from using IE6 to using Firefox.  Before too long, between tabs, quick searches, customizable toolbars, incremental page search, and more, I found myself saying, ""Wow, this is what browsing should be.  How did I ever use IE?""  Lisp is the same way.<p>I disagree with the article's conclusion, ""Learning Lisp is an uphill battle.""  If you have a good reference, it is not hard to start programming in Lisp.  You could learn Lisp by writing trivial code in about the same amount of time it would take to learn C or Java.  In fact, your code would probably be structured in much the same way.  Once you've learned enough Lisp, however, and once you get to the chapter on macros (of whatever Lisp reference you're using), something will click.  Then you will realize that you have been programming all wrong all along, and you will instantly rewrite everything you've ever done in one red-eyed night.  The next morning, you will be reborn.<p>But seriously, if you really want to learn Lisp, drop the $40 (or whatever it costs at the moment) on <i>ANSI Common Lisp</i>; it's a great read.  Once you plow through that and are hungry for more, look for <i>On Lisp</i> or <i>Practical Common Lisp</i>; both of them are available online.<p>If it wasn't for my classes with their requirements to program in C++ or Java, I never would have looked back after learning Lisp.  I think any good programmer who gives Lisp an honest try will feel the same way.",,9661,,,,,
