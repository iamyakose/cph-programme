    "\n",
    "  * Write your own blockchain. You can do that in the language and technology of your choice. Additionally, you choose network protocols and data exchange formats according to what you deem most suitable.\n",
    "  * Your blockchain has to be able to run on a network of distributed nodes. That is, use either containers, virtual machines, or machines in the cloud as your nodes.\n",
    "  * Implement actions, such as, adding transactions, mining of blocks, a simple consensus algorithm of your choice, etc.\n",

    "### Formal Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Of course, your network has to be a peer-to-peer network. \n",
    "  * There have to be at least four nodes in your blockchain network.\n",
    "  * You do not need a UI for your application. It is sufficient if it can ingest calls to API endpoints correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Provide a reproducible setup. That is, provide a Bash script, that can be run from any Linux machine, which instantiates your blockchain with some example nodes and which executes a test scenario on your blockchain.\n",
    "  * Provide a screencast demonstrating all functions of your running blockchain, with the help of the above script.\n",
    "  * Provide references to **all** sources that you used for your implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hand-in Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Provide all code, documentation (a Markdown (.md) file called `README.md` in the root of your project), etc. for this assignment in a repository on Github.\n",
    "  * Create a release of your project on Github, see https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/\n",
    "  * Hand-in a link to the **release** on Moodle, see https://help.github.com/articles/linking-to-releases/\n",
    "  * Hand-in at latest on Tuesday 18th Dec. 2018 at 23:59. You will upload a link to the **release** on Moodle (one link per group).\n"
