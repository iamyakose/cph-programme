## Transfer formats, XML and JSON

  * Read about marshalling and unmarshalling of XML and JSON in the second part of chapter seven in the book _Go Web Programming_, see `Go_Web_Programming_Chap7_part2.pdf`.
  * To get an introduction to XML syntax, read chapter 1 of "XML - Visual QuickStart Guide" , see `XML_Visual_QuickStart_Guide_chap1.pdf`.

## One more protocol - HTTP

  * Read the original proposal of the _World Wide Web_ https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html together with the original implementation of HTTP, see https://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/AsImplemented.html and https://www.w3.org/History/19921103-hypertext/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/HTTP.html. For the historical curious, you can read the Original WWW announcement here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/comp.sys.next.announce/avWAjISncfw

  * If you are interested in the new HTTP 2 standard you can read about it here https://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/HTTP2.html and here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2. However, HTTP 2 will not be in focus of this course.
  * Read chapter 8 of _"Network Programming with Go"_, see `Network_Programming_with_Go_Chap8.pdf`.
  * Alternatively, read the introduction to HTTP in chapter 1 in _"Go Web Programming"_, see `Go_Web_Programming_Chap1_part.pdf`.

  * To develop a feeling for the commonalities and differences between a `GET` and a `POST` request, you might want to watch the following video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UObINRj2EGY.


## RPC
  
  * To prepare our work on remote procedure calls (RPC) read chapter 13 of _Network Programming with Go_, see `Network_Programming_with_Go_Chap13.pdf`
  * To get a visual explanation of RPCs, you may want to watch the following video again https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gr7oaiUsxSU.
  
## RMI in Java

  * Since remote method invocations became well known with Java, read about them in chapter 18 of the book _Java Network Programming_, see `Java_Network_Programming_Chap18.pdf`.
  * Alternatively, you have the official documentation at Oracle:
    * https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/rmi/overview.html  
    * https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/rmi/server.html
    * https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/rmi/client.html
    * https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/rmi/example.html
    * http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/index-jsp-138781.html
